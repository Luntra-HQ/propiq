## greg isenberg: how i use agents to make money 

00:00:00
Today's episode, we are going to talk about an introduction to Vibe Marketing. Now, if you're listening to this, you've probably heard of Vibe Coding, but you might have not have heard of Vibe Marketing, and I'm going to break down exactly what it is, why you should care, why this is going to propel your business, your startup idea, and why most people should actually be focusing on Vibe Marketing a little more than Vibe coding. I'm actually going to give away a bunch of workflows of how you can


00:00:25
do Vibe Marketing. Towards the end, I'm going to talk about some of the tools uh that you could use. And by the end of this, you should have a pretty good foundation of how you can get going uh do vibe marketing, use AI, use agents to automate a lot of the tedious marketing tasks. [Music] So, uh, before I begin, if you're new to the channel, new to the startup ideas podcast, why you should listen to me. I've started and sold three ventureback companies. I was an adviser to Tik Tok. I was an adviser to Reddit. And, uh, I


00:01:06
am a co-founder in LCA, which is a design agency for the AI age. We literally work with pretty much all the biggest AI companies or software companies looking to get into AI. So I know a thing or two about um consumer businesses, growing them, marketing uh and AI. So I posted this on on X and it went absolutely uh viral. I said vibe marketing is the new marketing. So when you think about what is vibe coding, right? Vibe coding is using tools like bolt, raplet, lovable. What is uh Vibe marketing? Well, it's actually the


00:01:42
combination of some of these Vibe coding tools with things like Gum Loop, Manis, N8N, Tascade, and it's using AI agents and workflows to actually go and build marketing campaigns. So, my co-founder, uh, Boring Marketer, and shout out, uh, shout out to him, James, for helping me kind of put some of these present, uh, presentation materials together. He's the goat when it comes to VI market marketing. Uh he said something that I totally uh resonate with which is marketing will resemble highfrequency


00:02:15
stock trading in the near future. Agents working 24/7 monitoring surfacing opportunities personalized micro interactions. You'll be like a portfolio manager or day trader adjusting risk deploying money based on real-time market signals. I totally believe that's where we're going. Why is VI marketing even happening in the first place? I think it's because three things have actually converged at the same time. One is that AI got good enough at marketing tasks. So now agents can actually handle


00:02:47
the execution. I don't even think that was true a month ago, by the way. So this is happening in real time. Two, Vibe coding tools made automation accessible to non-developers. No coding required. And three, the custom tool building costs have basically collapsed. So you can build personalized software for pennies basically. Um and because of that, you know, you can basically do a lot of customized marketing campaigns. The old world and the new world. The old world of marketing was basically having


00:03:19
these bigger teams, 10 specialists, SEO people, copywriters, designers, analytics people, media buyers. These guys were these people are basically working in silos. you know, they're in meetings, they're in Slack threads, and it takes a while to launch when you have a lot of people. This new world, and which gets me so excited about this new world is, you know, you don't have to raise millions of dollars or have a huge team to actually go and uh and run with this. You basically need a single smart


00:03:47
marketer with taste, of course. Uh pair that with AI agents and workflows. We'll get into workflows by the end. I will I'm I'm not going to leave you hanging. testing tons of marketing angles in real time with hundreds hundreds of AI agents running the show launching in days, not weeks. So, uh before we do get into the workflows, let's just talk about what you need to get started, uh in the Vibe marketing toolkit. Uh some of this may be obvious to to some people. You're going to want to have a vibe coding tool


00:04:18
like Replet, Bolt, Lovable. So, um, you know, it it is crazy that you can with a prompt go make me a website for new homeowners that help subscribe to exclusive content with flexible payment options. I mean, today, the fact that you can actually put in a prompt and get a prototype uh is a gamecher when you're creating a lot of these uh marketing campaigns. Uh, you're going to want to play with something like NAN. So, NAN, you know, this is their their homepage, flexible AI workflow automation for


00:04:51
technical teams. So, you see they have this um flowchart. Uh so, you can basically create these flowcharts that basically help you drag and drop and automate uh with AI agents um and different tools. But I will say one thing, I think NAND is for, you know, more of the experts. Um, so, uh, definitely fun to play around with, but you know, you do need to be pretty savvy to use it. If people want, I can do an NAN, uh, demo and tutorial. Uh, just let me know in the comment section. Uh, Gum Loop is a lot


00:05:25
like NADN, but there are some more guard rails. Um, so you know, the example they use on their website, you can scrape a website, scrape a website, you can ask AI, and then you can write it into a Google Sheets. So, uh, it's a lot like NAN, but there's it's just a the it's more user friendly. Um, and, uh, yeah, that's Gum Loop. Um, I also did an episode with Flo from lindy.ai. Uh, in a lot of ways, it's similar to Gum Loop. Um, it's it's basically like an NAN agent platform


00:06:01
that allows you to, uh, basically automate a bunch of stuff. So, uh, if you haven't checked out the, um, the episode with Flo, um, you know, we we kind of went through how to automate, uh, a a recruiter, how to do sales prospecting, all automated, uh, all using AI agents and not just one agent, hundreds, or what they call agent swarms, which is a key part of I marketing. Quick break in the pod to tell you a little bit about Startup Empire. So, Startup Empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people


00:06:41
like me, like you who want to build out their startup ideas. Now, they're looking for content to help accelerate that. They're looking for potential co-founders. They're looking for uh tutorials from people like me to come in and tell them, "How do you do email marketing? How do you build an audience? How do you go viral on Twitter?" All these different things. That's exactly what Startup Empire is. And it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people


00:07:11
who have a startup but just they're not seeing the traction uh that they need. So you can check out the link to startupmpire.co in the description. Uh Manis, I've done an episode on Manis before. Um, in fact, you know, I actually threw this presentation into Manis to help design and and help me think through it. So, the fact that I can do that is, you know, it's kind of meta, but that's vibe marketing, right? You know, I I put it in here and it helps me kind of think through what I


00:07:41
need to put in here. You know, it's a designer, it's a strategist, it's a McKenzie level analyst. Uh, so highly recommend playing with that. And then of course um Claude or Clude as I say uh you can definitely use it to uh you know write. It's probably one of the best writing tools out there right now. Open router um you know people know this a bit less uh but it's basically a way to get one single AI key that helps manage multiple multiple models. So, um, you know, if you're creating, you know, if


00:08:17
if you want to use DeepSseek R1 for this and open AAI 03 for that, uh, using something like open router is something that you're going to want to play around with. Sora, I've done episodes on this before. Well, chat GBT image den uh you know one of the interesting things that Jacob Posel said on on on the tuto on one of our tutorials uh on on on the channel was that he actually thinks that Sora is you know you get better results on Sora than you do on chat GBT image gen. But this idea that you can go into


00:08:50
a Sora or Chat GBT image gen and generate these extremely high quality uh photos, videos um and content. I mean, how doesn't that change the game in social, right? Like, how, you know, it it helps arm you with this huge uh advantage, unfair advantage to actually go and create content that's going to resonate with your audience. So, this is something um that my co-founder, Boring Marketing, put together uh for for his holding company, and I think it's one of those things that I think uh everyone


00:09:24
should basically do. Um, it's a scorecard. Um, and the reason I put it in here is it's a scorecard of all the different models. You can see 40 mini, 03 mini, gro 3, uh, code 3.7, deepsee reasoner, perplexity, sonar, deep research. And it basically scores it by analyst brief blog. And the point of this is that uh certain models are going to be better for certain things for whatever it is you're doing within Vibe Marketing. though you know I talked about you know when it comes to uh you know writing for


00:09:59
example blog creation you can see at the bottom here uh you know code 3.7 it's actually amazing for content brief and blog creation so you know well-crafted blog with humanlike content it understands brand voice and maintains consistency and adds relevant internal links when we add it for when when we uh when we add website for it to refer to now you have to figure out uh for yourself which which models and which LLMs are going to be your LLM marketing friends. Some things are going to be better, some things are going to be


00:10:32
worse, and I encourage people to actually go and create scorecards so that they know uh what's working uh for them. I will say as a caveat that these models are changing all the time. I've noticed actually over the last couple weeks that uh code 37 is actually kind of getting worse at writing. So uh you know, you got to continue update this. So, the moment you've all been waiting for. Let's actually see some workflows so we can learn how you can copy uh Vibe Marketing Pros and and start automating


00:11:04
you and just sort, you know, you can lay on the beach while this this weird, you know, robot thing is going to serve you cash. Let's talk about um basically a few workflows here. So, uh, for your stack on this, uh, you're going to want N8 to N. You're going to want a Google Sheets, you're going to need an AI model, you're going to need Google Cloud Console, you're going to need, um, some data sources, so social platforms or other inputs, and you're going to need open router, which we


00:11:31
talked about before. It's basically access multiple AI models through one API. Now, once you have that stack, you're going to be able to create a few different workflows. You'll be able to create a data analyzer, so you can connect sheets with AI for insights. You'll be able to create a content monitor. You can scrape Reddit and summarize with AI. You can create a competitor alert, get notifications of competitor posts, email summarizer, weekly AI summaries of emails. You can even do a meeting


00:11:59
assistant, although this exists uh a a lot, you know, in other products. Um but uh yeah basically the formula is you pull data from sources, you transform it with AI, you analyze the results, you apply insights to strategy, and you create a closed loop uh strategy with output. So this is just some really really simple ways to actually create some of your first workflows. We're going to get to more interesting stuff um over here. So Jordan Mix, who uh is a partner at Late Checkout, my holding


00:12:30
company, uh who has been on the pod before, had this really cool thing where um his workflow was the one-click CRM. So he basically uh was able to um you know, you can think of the use case of this podcast, the Startup Ideas podcast, every single week having a uh here's the five guests that we should invite on the podcast. uh automated uh and it's and and vetted and reaching out based on their social links basing based on other content that they've done. So, how does it work? You uh step one is you trigger


00:13:05
with Gum Loop browser extension. Um and you can check that out on your own time, but um the browser extension basically uh you know what, I can show it to you real quick. It's this Chrome extension that automates your browser with AI. So basically, you can record your browser actions and replay them with a single click. No coding required. You can scrape and process web content with AI. Um, so super helpful. It's a Chrome extension, by the way. I'm not affiliated with Gum Loop or uh yeah, I'm


00:13:40
not affiliated with with this company at all. Uh, and let's go back to the presentation. Yeah, someone asked me, "Are you filming with Gum Loop?" No, no, I just I'm trying to give you the sauce. I want to see what you can create. Um, and, uh, let's, uh, let's continue. So, uh, you trigger with the Gum Loop browser extension. You scrape the website so you can get a transcript, for example, if it's a YouTube video. Then you can analyze the content and web search. Um,


00:14:14
you can extract the data. You get the social links and other relevant links. And then you can craft an outreach message, store it in Air Table, and then you can send a weekly summary to your team. Now, you actually don't even need to use Gum Loop for that. You can use Lindy, you can use other platforms. Um, but this is super cool because it does a lot of the heavy lifting, the boring stuff uh around actually figuring out who to reach out to and and how to reach out to them. Uh, this is a classic Vibe


00:14:43
Marketing uh example. Uh we I did a podcast on this how we basically built this Disney Pixar level videos of myself um using Chat GBT uh Leonardo Chat GBT was on the script writing I think Leonardo AI cling AI uh stitching that together to actually make these beautiful images move into videos and 11 labs for um for the voice and uh highly recommend to watch this. It's pretty long, but um it's an interesting way because you know why is this interesting in in the context of Vibe marketing?


00:15:20
Because if you can create there's this arbitrage moment that exists right now where you can actually go and create Pixar level content that's going to fly on social media if it's actually good uh and your competitors are not. Uh you can even create a completely AIdriven newsletter. So you use Google appcript that takes a topic and a point of view from a Google sheet and then and then uses perplexity for all the deep research uh code for writing and midjourney for images. Imagine that like


00:15:53
a completely AIdriven newsletter. Now, I know some people in the comment section are going to be like, "Oh my god, that's just going to be AI slop." And it might it might be AI slop, but if you have the right prompts um and you're Yeah, you have the right prompts and you do have some human in the loop at some point. Um it it you know, I I wouldn't say that's it's 100% true. I've seen AIdriven newsletters that are so so valuable and I love getting in my inbox and you you


00:16:24
probably didn't wouldn't even know that it's uh AI. Um okay, so how to scale content with Vibe Marketing. Couple tools that we're we're using NAN, Google Sheets, Open Router, Open AAI, and Clo37. So how it works, you get insight from specific subreddits. You come up with content ideas using open AI. You store the ideas. You get one idea per execution and then you use code point uh 3.7 to create content for LinkedIn, YouTube video scripts and blog post. Shout out to boring marketer who put this


00:17:00
together. Um I just think it's brilliant, right? Reddit, you have all these validated ideas and then you use open AI to sort of remix it and brainstorm. Um it's just it helps. You know so many people come to me and said say I you know I don't have time to do content I can't do content ideas I need a system for creating content this is your system vibe marketing is here sales agent you can create a you know use an LLM to validate a raw list of leads then get info from that website analyze it


00:17:32
generate a report and send custom outreach you don't need a junior salesperson literally just automate it using Vibe marketing e-commerce, a system that takes Amazon as that's like basically the Amazon skew, uh, and runs it through seven AI agents, pulls in reviews, keywords, search behavior, turns it into a full listing, bullets, titles, back-end terms, image overlay copy, even A+ content, all structured, all conversion focused. It's basically like having a strategist, copywriter, and SEO person


00:18:05
in one click. Are you getting fired up about Vibe marketing? I am just talking about it and it goes on and on you know um you can you could uh here's another content idea content one uh using NAN search reddit for relevant combos in my niche you know how much I like Reddit ex extract themes painoints for content ideas and then generate psychologically powerful hooks outlines and briefs and just store it in a Google sheet for editing so it's similar to what we saw before um but thinking you maybe you


00:18:36
just do it for hooks maybe you just do it for outines Maybe you just do it for briefs. Um, so this one is about, you know, who, you know, people who want to start YouTube channels but need content ideas. So first, you know, you're going to use again NAN, YouTube API, Open AI, Open Router, Google Sheets, Google Cloud. How you do it? Step one is you find videos. So you search YouTube for a keyword and fetch trending videos in your niche. Uh, then you extract the info, get title, description, views, and


00:19:05
channel details. Then you store the raw data. You save that video into Google Sheets. Analyze the content. Use AI to extract content angles from titles and descriptions. Generate ideas. Ask idea. Ask AI to suggest new video ideas based on those angles. And by the way, use the model that you know will come will come up with the best stuff here. And then store the results. So save those angles in Google Sheets all in the cloud. I don't you know those are just a few of the workflows I encourage people to go


00:19:35
and try and come up with their own. Use any tool you'd like. Uh this is where um you know I I think that the world of marketing is going to is really going to change over the next 12 to 18 months. This is an image from from my co-founder um where you know he said you know he says basically marketers using AI tools in isolated ways for specific outputs on individual channels. That's how people work today. But basically in the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to see an interconnected AI system working


00:20:04
together with shared contexts. You're going to have basically uh multiple AI agents and workflows. And these are going to be managed by manager agents trained by human experts. This is the future of marketing. Everyone marketers will evolve from individual ex uh executors to orchestrator of these systems. Small marketing teams of five will accomplish what previously required much larger teams. We talked about that. Adding new marketing channels isn't a, you know, won't require hiring. It's


00:20:32
literally just an agent away. Outputs will be more consistent and with less feedback cycles needed and systems will be goal oriented. So, it's going to be about telling your agents, hey man, I need 50,000 new organic visitors monthly. Go figure out how to do it. There's going to be real time adaptation. So, real-time adaptation will occur as systems analyze market gaps, create opportunities instantly. marketing might resemble high frequency trading. We talked about that. Um, you get the idea. Marketing is changing so


00:21:03
much right now and now is the time to actually get good at this vibe marketing stuff. So, what makes a good vibe marketer? I think that if you can think in systems, not campaigns, creating these like systems, these flowcharts type things, you'll outperform. If you're good at testing relentlessly, you know, now you're no longer testing two ads. you're testing 50 variations, 100 variations. You're doing a lot of testing every single day. Uh, and you're learning quick. Um, you're frontloading


00:21:32
value in everything you create. You know, you build once, you distribute forever, and you let machines handle the boring stuff. By the way, if you want to see more Vibe Marketing tutorials, highly recommend following Boring Marketer on X. Uh, he shares a bunch of workflows. Uh this is his agency where he automates five marketing um for folks. I'm a co-founder in this um and he also has a school community which will include in the links uh for other vibe marketers and uh I think he charges 100


00:22:12
bucks lifetime to join but the price goes up every 100 members. So, for for people interested, check it out. Um, that's the introduction to VI marketing. I hope that was helpful. I wanted to give you all the sauce. Didn't want to hold back. Um, if you enjoyed this thing, I think you you kind of you got to let me know at least. So, like, comment, and sub, and share this with a friend so you can go actually build something. I don't want you just to like, comment, and subscribe. That's not fun. I want you to


00:22:42
build something, and I want to see you win. I'm rooting for you. The best thing you can do uh is to actually just play with the tools. Uh see what you learn. Put it in your schedule. Every day I'm going to spend 30 minutes on this. I'm going to create a workflow. I'm going to automate this. I'm going to ask my team what are what are repetitive tasks that I can go and automate. Honestly, that's the best thing you can do. Um and that doesn't cost you any money. So, um a lot


00:23:10
of these platforms have free trials. um check it out, have fun, and uh and yeah, maybe we can use the comment section as a place to uh just share share our learnings and and share how we're feeling about this. So, um go get them. Till next time, that was the Startup Ideas podcast introduction to Vibe Marketing.


## greg isenberg: i'm revelaing all the vibe coding marketing secrets


00:00:00
[Music] There are people out there using AI to do marketing. People call it vibe marketing and are absolutely crushing it. And I think more people could be doing it. They just don't know how. They don't understand what are the different workflows. They don't understand which tools do I need to use. They don't understand where to start. And to be frank, it's really overwhelming. Not to mention, there's a bunch of people out there who are gatekeeping the workflows, gate gatekeeping the tools, and I went


00:00:32
out there to go and find, is there a definitive guide on buy marketing? I couldn't find it that wasn't paywalled. So, I'm just putting it out there for everyone to uh to listen and watch. By the end of this episode, you'll have a great understanding of which tools you need to care about in Vibe Marketing Land. How to actually get customers to whatever it is you're vibe coding you're putting out there. I'm just going to give you all the prompts. I'm going to give you the sauce. I'm going to help


00:01:02
you understand exactly how to get set up. I think it's going to shift your perspective around building a startup in today's age. So, without further ado, today's episode, your guide to a vibe marketing. Uh, how to get your first customers with AI. [Music] Vibe marketing is the new marketing. Um, and what is vibe marketing? It's basically, you know, you you know if you listen to the startup ideas podcast, you know about bolt and replet and lovable all these vibe coding tools. Um it's


00:01:42
basically this overlap between the vibe coding tools and the AI agent workflow tools um like Gum Loop and Manis and NADN. But the the most important thing to note if you're listening to this, like why should you even care about uh Vibe marketing is because there's an unfair advantage for people who understand AI in marketing right now. And I'm not sure how long this window lasts. Um you know, if you were a Facebook marketer in 2008, you had an unfair advantage. If you were in Consumer Mobile in 2010, uh when the


00:02:16
app store, you know, basically just came out, you had an unfair advantage. there's an unfair advantage that exists right now in Vibe marketing. Um, and there's different levels to vibe marketing. Some of it is really really technical. Um, but uh in this in this uh in this episode, we'll just talk about a few levels. We won't go super super deep. Um, so because I I want to make sure that beginners understand how to actually create these these workflows. So before we begin uh we have to do some


00:02:50
definitions and I have to explain uh how you can get started. So uh yes I use chat GPT yes I use madness. Yes I use grock but for vibe marketing specifically is what you need to use. And why do you need to use it is a few reasons. One is sonet 4 and opus are agents and you need agents to complete tasks for you and vibe marketing. two MCPs. You can use MCPs in code and you can't use it in uh some of the other platforms as well as artifacts uh which are basically just sharable web uh web apps.


00:03:30
So like you know let's just get into it like there's a there is a difference I want to just define like what is the difference between workflows and agents and how does MCPs play a role in that and like what is an MCP? The thing to know, I think MCP like just complicates it for people. The thing to know is that uh a workflow is something like an if this then that statement. So if this happens then go and automate this thing. That's not what we're trying to do with Vibe Marketing. What we're


00:04:01
trying to do with Vibe Marketing is we have goals in mind. So for example, I want a business health dashboard emailed to me weekly. And we want an agent, which is basically like this digital employee, go and access tools and data to go and deliver that results. So, if you're going to go and create a business health dashboard emailed uh to you weekly, you're going to need the agent maybe access Google Drive. You might need it to access an air table. Uh you might need it to access uh you know,


00:04:34
just your, you know, other data sources to deliver the results. And what the MCP is, you know, I'm dumbing it down, but what an MCP is is it allows the agent to access those tools and data. And that's what makes code so much uh so much more powerful. Once code gets access to all the tools and data, then we can go crazy and automate a bunch of stuff. Now they don't make it easy I will say to set up your MCPs within uh within code there's three steps that you need to do in order to do that you


00:05:12
have to download the the cloud desktop app you have to you know step two is you want to download the docker desktop app and step three you need to enable and configure apps uh you know within your code you know looks like that so that's what you need to do it's not super simple it'll take you like 10 minutes to do. I have a whole tutorial on it. Uh, you know, I did it with Riley Brown. Uh, you can go check it out. I'll link it in the, uh, description if you need more information how to set up MCPs in code.


00:05:46
So, once you have that set up, then you can go and have fun and build some crazy workflows. quick break in the pod to tell you a little bit about Startup Empire. So, Startup Empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people like me, like you who want to build out their startup ideas. Now, they're looking for content to help accelerate that. They're looking for potential co-founders. They're looking for uh tutorials from people like me to come in and tell them, "How do you do email


00:06:22
marketing? How do you build an audience? How do you go viral on Twitter? All these different things. That's exactly what Startup Empire is. And it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but just they're not seeing the traction uh that they need. So you can check out the link to startupmpire.co in the description. These are all these are some of the tools that I use um to build vibe marketing workflows. Uh, I'm


00:06:52
not going to get into every one of them over here. The point is that there's a bunch of tools. Find what works with for you and just get your hands dirty. Uh, let's go through all of the, uh, you know, some of the ones that I use the most. Uh, and let's just go through some of these workflows cuz you're going to learn about, you know, how to think like a vibe marketer through this. So I am sure that you have seen these AI videos that are basically like Minecraft uh videos uh with like a Reddit uh post


00:07:27
and it's 11 labs which is the AI audio that actually speaks to it. Now some people call this AI slop and I understand that. Um, but some of them are super valuable. Like this one, you know, it got 320,000 likes, so people obviously like it. And how powerful would it be if you owned a bunch of accounts that had like 150 200,000 followers that you can go and then send traffic to whatever it is you're working on. If you're working on a SAS app, if you're working on a consumer mobile app,


00:07:58
it's super super helpful. But how do you actually go and you know create a workflow that automatically creates these uh this short form content uh on tab. So that's what we were kind of exploring. Uh the way to do it is uh you have an air tra uh air table trigger and it gets you know Reddit posts. It it it analyzes those Reddit posts to see you know is it the right topic? Is it the right fit? Uh, is it the right subreddit? Um, it prepares the article for content generation. Um, and then it generates


00:08:36
the images and videos. It could use something like V3 or Runway ML to actually go and create that. Now, uh, uh, V3 has audio and video. So, which is, you know, really helpful. It, you know, you can you stitch you stitch it all together. Um, and then you post it to social media. So, that's what the workflow looks like. Um, if it's more helpful, you can see it over here. Um, you know, you're scraping interesting posts on Reddit. You're storing those Reddit posts in Air Table. You're doing


00:09:06
quantit qualitative analysis to see if it's relevant. You're preparing it for content generation. You're creating two 60-cond videos with Runway ML or VO3. You're stitching it together with Creatomate, and you're posting it on social. Don't forget, by the way, look at the terms and conditions um to see, you know, if this, you know, doesn't break terms and conditions. Um but this is an interesting concept, right? How do you scrape uh social media like Reddit to go and uh create short form video


00:09:39
content using VO3 uh and runway ML to ultimately create a network of like essentially meme like meme uh social accounts and then use that to actually generate thousands of mobile app downloads for example on whatever it is you're building. This uh the second workflow is something uh that my business partner Jordan Mix um he created and we have this issue on the podcast honestly that uh it's hard to it's hard to find guests and reach out to them. Um we you know we're often on X and


00:10:21
browsing X and we'll see an interesting people uh someone's interesting but our dream was basically click one button. We call it the one-click CRM and have an AI agent, you know, scan the internet, store information about that one, that person, and send a weekly summary to our team. So, what I what do I mean by that? I mean like I'll find someone interesting on X, I just want to press a button that uh that basically says like, is this person legit? Like, I don't want to actually go and do the research. Um,


00:10:49
they seem legit from their last tweet that they did, but go and do the research. um and store it in an air table and you know even prepare a personalized outreach message to that person. So I don't actually have to go and do that and I can just press one button if I want to reach out based on that research. So it's basically like having a you know an AI researcher in in our pocket. The way the way it works is through something called a gum loop browser extension. So um you just press a button. I'm on like the X page. Let's


00:11:23
say I I find uh the boring marketer bor boring marketer on X really interesting. I'll I'll literally press the gum loop uh extension. It scrapes what it sees on the screen. Uh it analyzes the content. It extracts the data um around who that person is. It crafts the outreach message and uh it sends a weekly summary to my team. So this is what it looks like from a workflow perspective. Um, and a lot of people who are listening to this might be like that's cute. Like you could, you know, good for


00:12:01
you. You can just reach out to more guests now. But like it's way more than just guests, right? Like you can use this for sales. So maybe you find a potential uh client who is really, you know, maybe it's on LinkedIn or X and you just want to press a button and just be like, is this the right, you know, do they fit my ICP? Um, you know, could you craft a personalized email to them? Right? So you just it's it's really cool because it allows you to press one button, adds it to this to your CRM, and


00:12:32
then you as the human can decide if you actually want to reach out to them, and then you press one button, and it could send that email. So cool. That also could be used for recruiting, right? Um let's say you're hiring a product designer. Uh you're you're on X and you're you're you're you're browsing X. You see some really good designer that you think, but you want to actually see like, oh, you know, h have they worked long uh for other companies? Are they fresh out of school? you know, depending


00:13:00
on what you want, uh, you can actually just press a button, add them, uh, to your to your CRM, and then it'll craft that outreach message, and you can just press a button if you want to actually go and reach out to them. So, this can be used for sales, recruiting, partnerships. I use it for booking podcast guests. But this is what the workflow looks like. Um, the question for you is, you know, what what would be really interesting for you? you know what from a research and outreach perspective, this is how you can use Gum


00:13:31
Loop. And by the way, I'm not saying you need to use Gum Loop. Um, you know, maybe use Lindy.ai, use whatever works for you. Um, but, uh, you know, the important thing is asking yourself the hard question around, you know, what is something that you can automate from a research and outreach perspective. Okay, cool. So, I find this one really cool. Um, vapy.ai. I don't know how many of you have heard of it, but basically it allows you to create voice AI agents. So, uh, why why create voice AI agents


00:14:12
is because you want to sell 247 and you can use voice to sell and you can set up a 1-800 number. So for example for us you know we've been building this startup called ideab browser.com which uh is the number one software to spot trends and startup ideas worth building. Um but we're like hey wouldn't it be cool if we reached out to our email list and to some of them and sent them a 1-800 number and said hey do you want to do you want to you know you have to incentivize them to call you. So you


00:14:46
have to say like you know do you want a potential discount? Do you want to give that do you want to give away uh you know an extra idea here for example? Do you want to just say do you want to say hey we're collecting feedback give us a call and there's a there might be a gift for you at the end. So uh you know reaching out to you know for us you know what what we wanted was is basically to create this voice AI agent that's a salesperson but is also collecting research uh like what do people like


00:15:17
about the product? What do people don't like? So that we can make a better experience for people. That was the goal. You know it wasn't just about selling. So uh here's the sauce. You're an agent on the phone with an interested prospect for idea browser. Idea browser is the number one place the spot and identify startup ideas worth building. Uh really important to add your ideal customer here. Um so add the different customer types. So like for us it might be entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial-minded people. Uh you


00:15:45
want to add you want to add context around what your product does. So features, pricing, testimonials. And what really worked for us is start the prompt with I'm an AI. Please don't hang up. I'm valuable. Why that's so important is because a lot of people have negative feelings towards AI. They much rather talk to human beings, especially normal people. Uh so as soon as you say something like that, it actually like kind of humanizes it um and uh becomes a lot more um enjoyable for the person on the other other end.


00:16:20
So we used uh Lindy, you can see our workflow here. Um once a call completes with our voice agent, it actually sends us a transcript and summary. And this is kind of this is the insights I was talking about. So uh the two main goals of the voice AI agent, number one, to sell, number two, to give us a transcript and summary so we can learn and make the product better. This is fun to play with. Uh it integrates with Twilio. Um you know, again, you're going to want to add your data and custom prompts. Um, but pretty cool that you


00:16:55
can sell in your sleep using voice AI. If you want to take a step up from voice AI, uh, you can actually create an AI persona. Uh, like this is my AI persona and this is me having a Google it looks like a Google Meet. I'm having a conversation with myself and it's crazy that you can create that with something called Tavis. Tavis.io. Um, although you can look at my eyes. I look I look I look like uh a little soulless. But you know that that's the thing with uh the AI personas. They're


00:17:30
like 93% there. They're not 100% there, but it's worth playing with. Okay. How I got to learn about Tavis was the bolt. Creating the world's largest hackathon. I went to the website. I saw uh this video or it was a picture actually of Eric and I know Eric. I've met him in real life. We've high-fived. Um and I I was like, "Oh, this is interesting. I can have a video chat with Eric." And I had a fiveminute video chat with Eric where he was helping me come up with ideas for the world's largest hackathon.


00:18:07
Makes a lot of sense, right? A lot of people might want to join this hackathon, but they they don't have an idea and you need an idea if you're joining a hackathon or what are you going to build? So that set a light bulb moment in my head that there's so many use cases around how you can actually nurture your potential customer using an AI persona audio video and you're basically having a v allowing them to have a video chat. Also, in a world where it's founder, you know, founder


00:18:44
marketing is so important, you know, I'm sure I'm sure uh Eric has 25, 30, 50,000 followers. He's tweeting um so people know who he is. Um and it's pretty novel to have like a voice AI conversation. So, I thought this was really cool. Um I started creating one before this um where I thought it would be cool to do a similar thing but for idea browser. So you can essentially embed, you know, my idea was very similar. It's like, hey, people are coming to ideabrowser.com, but some people might want to like jam


00:19:19
with me on startup ideas. Uh, and wouldn't it be cool if this actually worked? Um, and by the way, it's surprisingly uh like it surprisingly works if you do like the hack to it is you have to add you have to Okay, you have to add a you have to basically create a persona. Let me let me walk through the steps of how to get the most out of Tavis. One is you upload one minute of you, a video of you, one minute. Two is you create a persona within Tavis. You'll see the persona tab on the lefth hand side.


00:19:54
Three is you want to add a system prompt because that adds personality. Otherwise, it's so dry that it's not fun to have a conversation and people do want to have fun when they're talking with you. Number four is you're going to need to add conversational context and the more context the better. um you don't want to have a dumb you know conversation around ideas if you're trying to for example in this use case around for for us is like we want the Greg the AI version of Greg to know a


00:20:23
lot about startup ideas right so the more context the better and then you just embed it on your website and you're building trust with your website visitors 247 so this is cool fun to play around with um again I don't think it's 100% there yet but I think that in the future you're going to see this. You're going to see more of this. You're just going to see like a tab or just embedded on homepages where uh you can get uh you know the founder um to just like nurture people not exactly selling like


00:20:57
I don't think you'd want to do this for selling but having a conversation educating um really really interesting use case. You might have seen the tutorial I did around string.com. I like I find string.com interesting because you can just prompt it to create an automation. Um I had this idea that uh well actually it came from some one of you. Um some of you were on ide.com and you were like hey it's cool that every day you get a new idea but you know I'm commuting and I don't want to


00:21:28
read. So could you create like a two-minute podcast on the idea of the day? So I asked string.com if it can do that and it can. I basically was like um can you Yeah, I asked it can you do it and here's the workflow. So um I you know step one was I asked string to create the workflow. Step two is I had to connect um my 11 labs API key because it uses that to create the the um the audio. And by the way, you don't have to use 11 Labs. You can use whatever you want. There was a bunch of errors when I did it. Uh I just clicked


00:22:09
like fix errors, fix errors. Um there was one error that it didn't know how to fix. Um I just went to chat GBT uh and I was like here's the error like help me fix it and it helped me figure it out. Or you can ask string like I don't really understand. Uh help me figure this out. But it's really cool. I created this uh agent that every every day at 9:00 a.m. it goes onto Idea browser. It scrapes it uh scrapes the idea of the day. It creates a podcast script. It converts the audio to 11


00:22:42
Labs. Um if I wanted, you can see on the lefth hand side, it would even create intro and outro music, generate episode titles and descriptions, um automatically upload it to Spotify or Apple. Like it's pretty insane. And I listened to a few of them and they're pretty damn good. So this is completely possible. Um, you know, the alpha here is that, you know, I'm sure a lot of people here are create written content, but how do you how do you generate that into audio, right? Getting into people's


00:23:14
ears every single day is a huge huge huge trust building uh opportunity. So, you know, using string.com or or whatever tool you want to use to go and do that for you, uh, super valuable. And, you know, while I was playing with this, it gave me some more ideas for string. Uh, so here's some more sauce for you to to get you your you you thinking about uh, you know, what other ways I can use something like string. So, you can write a blog post, you know, automated. You can, you know, write a LinkedIn post, a tweet storm. um ask it


00:23:52
to do trans uh to transform normal photos, enhance it, remove backgrounds, you do it studio studio gibli. So the world's your oyster with something like string. I think that's kind of like the hard part. Uh because you know, how do you figure out what to automate if you can automate everything? So I just included some ideas for you on over here. There's one more automation that most people I think would find really really valuable here. I was kind of tired of going to Post Hog dot post hog


00:24:24
which is our analytics provider for idea browser and stripe to see like how we're doing and I also wanted to keep my team updated with our metrics. So I was just like hey could you create a I went to string I was like could you create a daily health report for my business and send it to my team in Slack. Um I literally just prompted it. You can see my prompt here. I want I want you to look at my analytics for my website in Postto and I want a detailed report of those analytics, visitors, clicks, how


00:24:51
many people signed up to my newsletter. Uh I also want you to check Stripe and see how many people paid that day, what our conversion rate is. And I want those delivered in a daily summary into Slack channel. And it did it in like 10 minutes. Pretty crazy. Pulled up how many visitors, how many customers, how much revenue, and now our whole team is aligned. Um and that's what the workflow looks like. Easy. Uh another workflow is going to be around uh AI ads. So I I started using AI ads and I had a bad


00:25:35
experience. I was like these aren't really good until I started using this workflow and the problem was I wasn't using it correctly. So, Arc Ads is the um AI ads uh platform that I've been using recently. I'll include a a link to it in the description. And I created a Gum Loop workflow that that works to basically create high converting ads on ARC ads. And I'm giving away the sauce. So, one is I I would input an ads of a competitor or an inspiration. So, imagine Athletic Greens, AG1, right?


00:26:14
Uh, so they spent they spent millions of dollars on ads. I'll just input like their URL. Um, and what uh what it does is it scrapes all their ads from Meta. it analyzes uh that those ads um and we ask it to uh to create ad those ads but for our use case. So let's say we're creating ideabrowser.com ads. It would be like, "Hey, like I like I like what's going on with these AG1 athletic greens ads, but how do you apply that to ideabrowser.com?" And then I give a context as to what we do. And then Arc


00:26:59
Ads literally creates the videos from that. It adds it to a Google Drive and then it posts to Slack when it's ready. So, pretty insane that you can go and take inspiration from from ads that are working that people are spending millions of dollars a year on. You analyze what's working. You apply it to uh whatever it is you're doing and then you keep your team updated uh as to as to, you know, when it's ready. So, pretty crazy. Um, and just wanted to share that the last workflow I wanted to


00:27:41
share actually has nothing to do with AI, but to me is still still in this world of VI marketing. Here's how I added 20,000 Instagram followers in 30 days. And I added thousands of emails doing so to my newsletter. And I'm going to show you how I do it. I post a short form video and I ask people to comment some keyword. I'm sure you've seen short form like that. And the reason they're commenting, let's say YT is because they can get like the longer form content in their inbox. So they here's my workflow.


00:28:15
Um, you know, I asked them to comment YT. They they uh they say, you know, it says, "Hey there, you know, drop your email so I can send you the tutorial." People drop their email. Uh, and they also get the video for where I talk talk more about that. So, it's kind of a win-win. I get their email. Uh, it it it makes the post go viral. I actually had one post get 124,000 likes a couple weeks ago, uh, on IG. And what it does is it adds it via via Zapier to my kit.com, uh, which is what I use to send email


00:28:58
newsletters, uh, personal email newsletters. But it what's cool about it is it tags it per video. Uh tags it based on what video. So I'll tag it, you know, if it's coming from this video, which is about like how to grow on YouTube and Patty Galloway, uh who helped Mr. Beast grow on YouTube and stuff like that. I'll be like, "Oh, hey, tag it YT YouTube." And then I can send it a specific welcome sequence like five email welcome sequence and it could be different than if someone came


00:29:33
in from an AI tool video uh because they want different things or someone who came in from a community video because they want different things. So what's really cool about this is you can create different welcome sequences two three four five emails based on where they come in. Uh so I really like this flow because it you know generates you know you know the caveat is you need short form that people resonate with. Um but you know if you can do that then this is a really good way to get thousands of emails on autopilot. Um and


00:30:07
then have a welcome sequence that builds trust based on what their outcomes are. There you have it folks. This has been the guide to vibe marketing. If this has been interesting to you, share it with a friend. Get other people's creative juices flowing.
