## The Growth Framework

SEO is **passive traffic** (60-90 days to results). You need **active distribution** now.

**The 3 Pillars:**
1. **Content Distribution** - Get existing blog posts in front of people (free)
2. **Paid Acquisition** - Buy traffic strategically (low budget)
3. **Community & Partnerships** - Leverage existing audiences (free)

---

## 📅 30-Day Plan: Free Distribution & Quick Wins

**Goal:** Get 500-1,000 visits to your blog posts in the next 30 days (all free).

### Week 1: Social Media Foundation (5 hours)

**LinkedIn (Priority #1 - Your best channel):**

1. **Share each blog post as a LinkedIn article** (30 min/post)
   - Reformat your blog posts for LinkedIn's native article feature
   - Post schedule:
     - Day 1: "The 1% Rule is Dead" (controversy = engagement)
     - Day 3: "7 Hidden Costs That Kill ROI" (practical value)
     - Day 5: "Cap Rate Calculator Guide" (educational)
     - Day 7: "PropIQ vs Spreadsheets" (positioning)

2. **LinkedIn post strategy:**
   ```
   Format for each post:
   - Hook (1 line): "95% of rental properties fail the 1% rule in 2025."
   - Story/Problem (3-4 lines): Context on why this matters
   - Insight (2-3 bullets): Key takeaways from your blog
   - CTA: "Full breakdown 👇 [link to blog post]"
   - Hashtags: #RealEstateInvesting #PropertyAnalysis #RealEstate
   ```

3. **Engage in real estate groups:**
   - Join 5 LinkedIn groups (search "real estate investing", "rental property")
   - Comment on 3 posts per day in these groups (10 min/day)
   - Drop your blog links when relevant (not spammy)

**Twitter/X (Secondary):**
- Create Twitter account: @PropIQ_Tools
- Tweet each blog post as a thread (5-7 tweets)
- Post 2x/day: 1 educational tip + 1 blog promo
- Engage with #RealEstateTwitter

**Reddit (High-value, low effort):**
- Post your blog content to relevant subreddits:
  - r/realestateinvesting (200k members)
  - r/RealEstate (500k members)
  - r/LandlordLove (for cap rate/ROI posts)
  - r/Fire (for 1% rule post)
- **Format:** Don't just drop links. Write a Reddit-native post summarizing your article, THEN link at the bottom
- Example:
  ```
  Title: "I analyzed 10,000 rental listings. Only 5% pass the 1% rule. Here's what works instead."

  Body: [2-3 paragraphs summarizing your findings]

  "Full breakdown with data here: [link]"
  ```

**Expected results (Week 1):** 200-400 blog visits

---

### Week 2: BiggerPockets & Real Estate Forums (3 hours)

**BiggerPockets (THE real estate community):**

1. **Create profile:** https://biggerpockets.com
2. **Join the forums** - this is where serious investors hang out
3. **Answer 5 questions per day** in these sections:
   - "Analyzing Deals"
   - "Rental Property Investing"
   - "General Real Estate Investing"
4. **Drop your blog links strategically:**
   - When someone asks "What's a good cap rate?" → Link your cap rate guide
   - When someone asks about cash flow → Link your hidden costs post
   - When someone mentions the 1% rule → Link your 1% rule post
5. **Post a "new tool" announcement:**
   - Title: "I built a free AI property analyzer (30-second analysis)"
   - Body: Your PropIQ pitch + link
   - Expected: 50-100 clicks

**Other forums:**
- REI Club forums
- Landlord forums
- City-specific real estate investing groups (Facebook)

**Expected results (Week 2):** 100-200 blog visits

---

### Week 3-4: Content Repurposing (4 hours)

**Turn your blog posts into:**

1. **YouTube Shorts / TikTok** (10 videos)
   - "Cap rate explained in 30 seconds"
   - "The 1% rule doesn't work anymore. Here's why."
   - "7 hidden rental property costs"
   - Each video = 1 key insight from your blog + CTA to full article
   - Tools: CapCut (free), Canva (free templates)

2. **Infographics** (3-5 visuals)
   - "7 Hidden Costs" → Visual breakdown
   - "Cap Rate Formula" → Step-by-step graphic
   - "PropIQ vs Spreadsheets" → Comparison table
   - Post on Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn

3. **Email newsletter** (if you have ANY email list)

**Expected results (Week 3-4):** 200-400 blog visits
