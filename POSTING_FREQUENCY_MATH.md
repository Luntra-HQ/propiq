## 🔢 The Numbers That Matter

### Vanity Metrics (Don't Obsess):
- ❌ Follower count
- ❌ Like count
- ❌ Impression count

### Business Metrics (Track These):
- ✅ Website visits from social
- ✅ Email sign-ups from social
- ✅ Trial sign-ups from social
- ✅ Paid conversions from social
- ✅ Cost per acquisition (time ÷ conversions)

**Formula:**
```
Social ROI = (Revenue from social - Time invested) ÷ Time invested

Example:
Month 6: $2,400 MRR
Time: 7 hrs/week × 26 weeks = 182 hours @ $50/hr opportunity cost = $9,100
Revenue from social: ~30% = $720/month × 6 = $4,320
ROI: ($4,320 - $9,100) / $9,100 = -53% (investment phase)

Month 12: $10,500 MRR
Time: 7 hrs/week × 52 weeks = 364 hours @ $50/hr = $18,200
Revenue from social: ~40% = $4,200/month × 12 = $50,400
ROI: ($50,400 - $18,200) / $18,200 = +177% (profitable)
```

**Lesson:** First 6 months is investment, 6-12 months is payoff
