```
- Note in phone: "TikTok: Max 5 hashtags, looks spammy otherwise"
- Source: [Creator name]
- Date: 2025-11-06
```

**2. Add to Cardinal Rules (2 minutes):**
- Open `SOCIAL_MEDIA_CARDINAL_RULES.md`

## 🧠 How to Remember Rules Without Checking

### The System Creates Memory Through:

**1. Repetition (Use Quick Checklist daily)**
- Day 1-7: Need to check every rule
- Day 8-21: Start remembering common ones
- Day 22+: Muscle memory, only check edge cases

**2. Experience (Log results)**
- When you see that sharing Reel to Story immediately = bad results
- Your brain connects: "Oh, THAT'S why they say don't do it"
- Experience > reading a rule

**3. Pattern Recognition (Weekly review)**
- "Every time I post at 10am, I get 2x reach"
- "Carousel posts always outperform single images"
- These become YOUR personalized rules

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks of daily use = rules become automatic

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: This seems like a lot of work**
A: Week 1 is slowest (10 min per post). By Week 3, it's 2 minutes. By Week 4, it's automatic.

**Q: I don't have time to log every post**
A: Start with just your best-performing posts. Something > Nothing.

**Q: The rules keep changing**
A: That's why you're documenting! Your Learning Log tracks what works NOW. Update Cardinal Rules as you learn.

**Q: Can I just use a scheduler app?**
A: Schedulers are great for batch posting, but post first one natively for best reach. Use these docs regardless of tool.

**Q: What if I forget to check the checklist?**
A: Set phone reminder before posting time: "Check social media checklist before posting"
