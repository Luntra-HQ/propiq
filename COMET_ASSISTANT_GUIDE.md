   I built PropIQ to solve my own pain point—waiting hours for analysis when I needed answers NOW. Curious if this resonates with you?

   Here's the site if you want to check it out: https://propiq.luntra.one

   - Brian
   ```

   (No strings attached—genuinely think this could be interesting for you)
   ```

**Success Metrics:**
- Connection acceptance rate: Target 40%+
- Response rate: Target 20%+
- Trial signups: Target 10%+ of conversations

### Workflow 3: Twitter/X Engagement

**Goal:** Build personal brand, drive awareness

**Content Pillars:**
1. **Quick Tips** (3x/week)
   - "🏘️ Quick REI tip: The 1% rule is a screening tool, NOT a buying criteria. PropIQ calculates the real numbers—cash flow, ROI, cap rate—so you don't just rely on rules of thumb."

2. **Behind-the-Scenes** (2x/week)
   - "Built PropIQ's AI analysis feature over the weekend. Went from 'spreadsheet hell' to 'instant insights' in 72 hours. Here's what I learned about GPT-4o-mini..."

3. **Case Studies** (1x/week)

4. **Engagement** (Daily)
   - Reply to REI influencers

- #PropIQ
- #REI
- #PassiveIncome
- #FinancialFreedom

---

### Workflow 4: Reddit r/realestateinvesting

**Goal:** Provide value, soft-sell tool

**Approach:**
- **Never** lead with the product
- **Always** provide genuine advice first
- Mention PropIQ only if directly relevant

**Template:**
```
I'd recommend running these numbers:

- Cap rate: [formula]
- Cash-on-cash return: [formula]
- 1% rule check: [math]

If you want to speed this up, I built PropIQ (full disclosure: I'm the founder) that does this in 30 seconds. But you can also just use Google Sheets with these formulas: [link to shared template]

Either way, here's what I'd focus on for your market...

### Welcome Sequence (5 emails)

**Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)**
```
Subject: Welcome to PropIQ! Here's your first free analysis 🏡

Hey [Name],

Thanks for signing up! You just got 3 free property analyses—let's use the first one right now.

Here's what to do:
1. Go to https://propiq.luntra.one
2. Click "PropIQ Analysis"
3. Enter any property address
4. Get your results in 30 seconds

Pro tip: Start with a property you're already familiar with—it's the best way to see how accurate PropIQ is.

Questions? Hit reply—I read every email.

- Brian
Founder, PropIQ

P.S. If you're not sure what address to analyze, try this one I found in Austin: [example address]. It's a solid 8.2/10 deal.
```

**Email 2: Educational Value (Day 2)**
```
Subject: The #1 mistake investors make when analyzing deals

[Name],

Quick story: I almost bought a "great deal" last year.

Cap rate? 8.5% ✅
Cash flow? $600/month ✅
1% rule? Passed ✅

Seems perfect, right?

Then I looked at the 5-year projection. With realistic vacancy rates and maintenance costs, my actual cash flow was going to be $180/month—not $600.

That's why I built PropIQ's 5-year projection feature. It shows you what deal REALLY looks like over time.

Try it here: [link]

More tomorrow,
Brian
```

**Email 3: Social Proof (Day 4)**
```
Subject: "This saved me 4 hours of spreadsheet work"

Just got this message from Sarah, a PropIQ Pro user:

"I used to spend an entire Sunday running numbers on deals. Now I can analyze 10 properties during my lunch break. PropIQ literally 10x'd my deal flow."

Want the same results? Upgrade to Pro for 20 analyses per month: [link]

Or stick with the free tier—no pressure either way!

- Brian
```

**Email 4: Feature Spotlight (Day 7)**
```
Subject: Did you know PropIQ can do THIS?

[Name],

Most people don't realize PropIQ has a hidden superpower: scenario analysis.

You can instantly see:
- Best case scenario (if everything goes right)
- Worst case scenario (if Murphy's Law strikes)
- Realistic scenario (the middle ground)

Here's how to use it: [short tutorial]

This feature alone is worth the Pro tier upgrade.

Try it: [link]

- Brian
```

**Email 5: Upgrade Offer (Day 10)**
```
Subject: Your free analyses expire in 48 hours

[Name],

Your 3 free analyses expire in 2 days. After that, you'll need to upgrade to continue.

Here's what happens if you upgrade to Starter ($29/mo):
✅ 20 analyses per month (analyze a new deal every 36 hours)
✅ Full feature access (deal calculator, AI chat, PDF export)
✅ Priority support
✅ Cancel anytime

Special offer: Use code EARLYBIRD for 20% off your first 3 months.

Upgrade here: [link]

Or... you can stay on the free tier and just not analyze more properties. Your call!

- Brian

P.S. If you're not ready to upgrade, no worries! You can always come back when you find a deal you want to analyze.
