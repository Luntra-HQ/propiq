**Step 3: Strategize**
Ask your AI publicist agent:
```
I have a content idea:

Using my strategic brief, should I do this?

- Solution: Manually label 5-10 existing emails to seed it
- Search: `from:justinwelsh OR from:beehiiv.com subject:revenue`
- Apply label manually

**"AI publicist doesn't know my context"**
- Solution: Re-share the Strategic Brief
- Say: "Reference AI_PUBLICIST_STRATEGIC_BRIEF.md for all strategy questions"

**"Too many emails in Content-Brain"**
- Solution: This is good! It means you're learning
- Weekly: Review and archive low-value examples
- Keep only the best 50-100 examples

**"Don't know what content to create"**
- Solution: Ask AI publicist for Q1 2026 content calendar
- Start with PropIQ use cases (most aligned)
