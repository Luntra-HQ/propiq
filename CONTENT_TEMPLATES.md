# PropIQ Content Templates
## 8 Reusable Templates for Daily Posting

## Template 1: Build Update
**Use When:** Shipping features, fixing bugs, making progress
**Frequency:** 2-3x per week (40% of content)
**Style:** Transparent, educational, relatable

```markdown
# Build Update Template

[HOOK: One sentence about what you just did]

[CONTEXT: Brief explanation of the problem]

Here's what I learned about [topic]:

1. [Lesson 1 with specific detail]
   → [Why it matters]

2. [Lesson 2 with specific detail]
   → [Why it matters]

3. [Lesson 3 with specific detail]
   → [Why it matters]

Building @PropIQ in public. Day [X].

[CALL TO ACTION: Ask a question related to the lesson]

#BuildInPublic #[Relevant] #PropIQ
```

**Example:**
```
Just spent 6 hours debugging our Chrome extension.

The issue? Content scripts weren't injecting on Zillow pages.

Here's what I learned about building browser extensions:

1. Playwright tests ≠ real-world usage
   → Always test manually in the actual browser

2. Service workers need explicit event listeners
   → Background scripts must register properly

3. MVP means "Minimum" not "Perfect"
   → Ship fast, iterate faster

## Template 2: Lesson Learned
**Use When:** Discovering insights, making mistakes, pivoting strategy
**Frequency:** 2x per week (30% of content)
**Style:** Humble, insightful, actionable

```markdown
# Lesson Learned Template

I just learned a [$ value or time value] lesson about [topic].

And it only cost me [what you actually paid/lost].

Here's what happened:

[STORY: Describe the situation in 3-4 sentences]

Then [turning point].

[NEW OUTCOME: What changed after the lesson]

The result?

→ [Metric 1]
→ [Metric 2]
→ [Metric 3]

But here's the REAL lesson:

[INSIGHT: The deeper truth beyond the surface lesson]

[PRINCIPLE: Universal rule you extracted]

Building @PropIQ taught me:

[ONE-LINER: Memorable takeaway]

[QUESTION: Ask audience for their experience]

#[Relevant] #Startup #BuildInPublic #PropIQ
```

**Example:**
```
I just learned a $10,000 lesson about deployment.

And it only cost me 10 hours.

Here's what happened:

We deployed PropIQ's backend to Azure. Deployment time: 10-15 minutes per push. Total deploys during testing: 12. Time wasted waiting: 2+ hours.

Then I switched to Railway.

Deployment time: 2-3 minutes.
Same 12 deploys: 24 minutes total.

The result?

→ 90+ minutes saved
→ 5x faster iteration
→ Shipped 3 features in one day

But here's the REAL lesson:

It's not about the tools. It's about iteration speed.

Fast feedback loops = faster product.

Building @PropIQ taught me:

Speed > Perfection in early stages.

What deployment setup do you use? 👇

## Template 3: Founder Journey
**Use When:** Sharing personal struggles, breakthroughs, emotional moments
**Frequency:** 1-2x per week (20% of content)
**Style:** Vulnerable, authentic, inspiring

```markdown
# Founder Journey Template

[PROVOCATIVE OPENING: Share a fear, doubt, or struggle]

Here's [what changed / the truth / what I learned]:

[BACKSTORY: Set the scene - where you were mentally/emotionally]

[THE MOMENT: Describe the turning point]

Not:
❌ [Old belief 1]
❌ [Old belief 2]
❌ [Old belief 3]

But:
✅ [New belief 1]
✅ [New belief 2]
✅ [New belief 3]

That clarity changed everything.

[ACTIONS TAKEN: What you did differently]

Now we're at:
→ [Progress metric 1]
→ [Progress metric 2]
→ [Progress metric 3]

Building @PropIQ in public. Day [X].

[REFLECTION: One-sentence truth about the journey]

[QUESTION: Invite others to share their journey]

#Founders #Startup #BuildInPublic #PropIQ
```

**Example:**
```
3 months ago, I almost quit PropIQ.

Here's what changed:

I was stuck in perfectionism. "The AI needs to be 100% accurate." "The UI needs to be flawless." "We need every feature before launch."

Classic founder trap.

Then my mentor asked: "What problem are you ACTUALLY solving?"

Not:
❌ Building the perfect AI
❌ Creating the prettiest UI
❌ Competing with Zillow

But:
✅ Helping investors make faster decisions
✅ Reducing analysis time from hours to minutes
✅ Giving access to AI for $29/month (not $5,000 consultants)

That clarity changed everything.

I cut 60% of planned features. Focused on ONE thing. Shipped an MVP in 3 weeks.

Now we're at:
→ Chrome extension live
→ Backend deployed
→ 5 beta users testing

Building @PropIQ in public. Day 47.

Clarity beats perfection every time.

What's the ONE question that changed your founder journey? 👇

## Template 4: Hot Take / Market Commentary
**Use When:** Industry news, trends, controversial opinions
**Frequency:** 1-2x per week
**Style:** Bold, contrarian, data-backed

```markdown
# Hot Take Template

[CONTRARIAN STATEMENT]

Here's why:

[COMMON BELIEF]: [What everyone thinks]

→ [Reality check 1]
→ [Reality check 2]
→ [Reality check 3]

[SUPPORTING DATA OR EXAMPLE]

So why do I still [believe X / do Y]?

Because when done RIGHT, it offers:

✅ [Benefit 1 with explanation]
✅ [Benefit 2 with explanation]
✅ [Benefit 3 with explanation]

But "done right" requires:

1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

This is exactly why I built PropIQ.

[HOW YOUR PRODUCT HELPS]

Agree or disagree? [Question to spark debate] 👇

#[Relevant] #PropIQ #[Industry]
```

**Example:**
```
Unpopular opinion:

Most people should NOT invest in real estate.

Here's why:

Real estate investing is HARD:

→ Requires $50K-$100K+ down payment
→ Illiquid (can't sell in 24 hours)
→ Maintenance costs (1-2% annually)
→ Tenant headaches
→ Time intensive (not passive)

Meanwhile, S&P 500 index funds require $1 and return 10% historically.

So why do I still invest in real estate?

Because when done RIGHT, it offers:

✅ Leverage (use bank's money)
✅ Tax benefits (depreciation, 1031 exchange)
✅ Cash flow (monthly income)

But "done right" requires:

1. Knowing the numbers (not guessing)
2. Analyzing deals quickly
3. Understanding local markets

This is exactly why I built PropIQ.

To help investors analyze deals in 2 minutes with AI-powered insights.

## Template 5: Customer Story
**Use When:** User sends feedback, testimonial, or success story
**Frequency:** 1x per week (when available)
**Style:** Grateful, specific, outcome-focused

```markdown
# Customer Story Template

[EMOTIONAL OPENING: How the story made you feel]

Here's what happened:

[USER'S SITUATION: Where they were before PropIQ]

[THE PROBLEM: What they were struggling with]

[THE DECISION: What action they took]

Then they used PropIQ:

→ [Specific action 1]
→ [Specific action 2]
→ [Specific result]

[QUOTE FROM USER]

[IMPACT: Dollar value or time saved]

This is why we build.

Not for:
❌ [Vanity metric 1]
❌ [Vanity metric 2]
❌ [Vanity metric 3]

But for:
✅ [Real impact 1]
✅ [Real impact 2]
✅ [Real impact 3]

Building @PropIQ in public. Day [X].

[GRATITUDE: Thank the user and community]

[CALL TO ACTION: Invite others to try]

#BuildInPublic #PropIQ #[Relevant]
```

**Example:**
```
I'm honestly emotional about this.

Here's what happened:

A user was about to buy a $600K property in Miami. They'd already talked to their agent. Loan was pre-approved. They were excited.

The problem: They hadn't run the numbers properly.

Then they used PropIQ:

→ Entered the property details
→ Got AI analysis in 2 minutes
→ Saw: -$800/month cash flow

"I almost bought this property.

Your AI showed -$800/month cash flow.

I would've lost $9,600 in the first year alone.

PropIQ just saved me from a terrible decision."

That's $9,600 saved in year 1. Potentially $50K+ over 5 years.

This is why we build.

Not for:
❌ Vanity metrics
❌ Investor applause
❌ TechCrunch articles

But for:
✅ Real people
✅ Making better decisions
✅ Saving them from expensive mistakes

Building @PropIQ in public. Day 47.

Thank you to everyone testing and giving feedback. 🙏

## Template 6: Milestone Celebration

One user messaged: "I analyzed 47 properties in 2 weeks using PropIQ. Found 1 great deal. Made an offer. It was accepted. Closing next month."

That's the dream: Help investors move FASTER and SMARTER.

That's why we build.

**Example:**
```
The 7 Financial Metrics Every Real Estate Investor MUST Know

(But most beginners ignore #4)

A thread 🧵

---

1/ Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)

Formula: Net Operating Income / Purchase Price

Example:
→ Purchase: $500K
→ Annual NOI: $30K
→ Cap Rate: 6%

What it means: Your annual return if you paid cash.

Good cap rate: 5-8% (depends on market).

---

2/ Cash-on-Cash Return

Formula: Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested

Example:
→ Down payment: $100K
→ Annual cash flow: $6K
→ CoC Return: 6%

What it means: Return on YOUR money (not the bank's).

Target: 8%+ is solid.

---

[Continue for 5 more metrics]

---

Why this matters:

Most people buy real estate based on "gut feeling."

That's not investing. That's gambling.

PropIQ calculates all 7 metrics automatically. In under 2 minutes.

Using AI that analyzes:
→ Location-specific market data
→ Realistic rent estimates
→ Cash flow projections

**Frequency:** 1x per week
**Style:** Story-driven, empathetic, solution-focused

```markdown
# Problem-Obsessed Template

[SHOCKING OPENING: Specific loss, mistake, or failure]

Not because [they're stupid / inexperienced / unlucky].

Here's what happened:

[TIMELINE]:
Month 1: [Initial situation]
→ [Details]

Month 3: [Problem emerges]
→ [Details]

Month 12: [Outcome]
→ [Total cost/impact]

The problem?

[WHAT THEY USED - List wrong tools/approaches]:

Building @PropIQ so you never have to learn the hard way.

What's your [horror story] in this space? 👇

#[Relevant] #PropIQ #[Industry]
```

**Example:**
```
I watched my friend lose $50,000 on a rental property.

Not because he's dumb.

But because he trusted the wrong data.

Here's what happened:

Month 1: He buys a "great deal" in Austin
→ Purchase price: $450K
→ Agent said: "Easy $2,500/month rent"

Month 3: Property sits vacant
→ Market rent: Actually $1,800/month
→ Losing $600/month

Month 12: He sells at a loss
→ Total loss: $50K

The problem?

He used:
❌ Zillow Zestimate (outdated)
❌ Agent's opinion (biased)
❌ "Gut feeling" (wishful thinking)

Not:
✅ Real market data
✅ Actual cash flow analysis
✅ Location-specific risks

This story haunts me. Because it's preventable.

That's why I built PropIQ.

It gives you:
→ AI-powered analysis in 2 minutes
→ Realistic rent estimates
→ Deal score (0-100)

For $29/month.

Less than one overpriced Zillow report.
