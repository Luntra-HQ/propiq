The 1% rule fails investors more than any other "rule of thumb" in real estate.

Here's a common scenario:

$400K property. Rent is $3,200/month. "It passes the 1% rule!"

Six months later, the investor is bleeding cash.

What the 1% rule doesn't account for:
- Property tax reassessments (can increase 20-50% after purchase)
- Insurance rate increases (up 30-40% in many markets since 2020)
- Deferred maintenance that inspections miss
- Actual vacancy rates (often 8-10%, not the optimistic 5%)

The 1% rule was created in the 1970s when interest rates, insurance costs, and property taxes were completely different. Using it today is like navigating with a 50-year-old map.

What actually matters in 2025:
✓ Cash-on-cash return (after ALL expenses)
✓ Debt service coverage ratio (can you handle a bad month?)
✓ 5-year projection with realistic vacancy rates
✓ Scenario analysis (best case, realistic, worst case)

I built PropIQ by LUNTRA to help investors move beyond outdated rules and see the full picture before committing capital.

Question for the real estate investors here: What outdated advice do you wish would die already?

After analyzing hundreds of rental property deals, one pattern is crystal clear:

Most deals are marginal at best.

In real estate investing, there's a huge gap between "looks good on paper" and "actually generates wealth."

What separates great deals from mediocre ones?

1. Purchase price - The best investors buy 15-20% below market (off-market deals, distressed properties, motivated sellers)

2. Conservative assumptions - They budget for reality, not best-case scenarios:
   • 8-10% vacancy rates (not 5%)
   • 1-2% of property value for annual maintenance
   • Real property tax amounts (post-reassessment)
   • Current insurance rates (not seller's old policy)

3. Scenario planning - They run three scenarios:
   • Best case (everything perfect)
   • Realistic case (industry averages)
   • Worst case (can I survive 6 months vacancy + emergency repairs?)

If the deal only works in the best case, it's not a deal.

The properties that lose money?
- Overpaying for "great location"
- Using seller's numbers without verification
- Ignoring CapEx (roof, HVAC, appliances)
- Assuming perfect tenants and zero problems

Real estate can absolutely build wealth. But the math has to work BEFORE you sign the deal.

That's why I created PropIQ by LUNTRA - to help investors run comprehensive scenario analysis in 30 seconds instead of 3 hours in Excel.

What's your #1 rule for evaluating rental properties?

2024. I was spending hours analyzing rental properties in Excel.

Same spreadsheets. Same formulas. Different addresses.

By the time I finished my analysis, the best deals were gone.

That's when it hit me: Speed = competitive advantage in real estate.

But speed without accuracy is just gambling.

So I built PropIQ - AI-powered analysis that's as thorough as my 3-hour spreadsheets, but completes in 30 seconds.

📊 What PropIQ analyzes:
• Cap rate, cash flow, ROI
• 5-year projections
• Best/realistic/worst case scenarios
• Risk scoring
• Market comparisons

🚀 Why it matters:
When you find a good deal, you need to move FAST. But you also need confidence in your numbers.

PropIQ gives you both.
