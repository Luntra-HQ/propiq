## 📱 LINKEDIN POST #1 - "The 1% Rule is Dead"

**When to post:** LinkedIn performs best 7-9 AM or 12-1 PM on Tuesday-Thursday

**Copy this:**

```
The 1% rule just cost an investor I know $80,000.

He bought a $400K property. Rent was $3,200/month. "It passes the 1% rule!" he said.

Six months later, he's bleeding cash every month.

Here's what the 1% rule doesn't tell you:
- Property taxes doubled after reassessment
- Insurance went from $1,200/year to $3,800 (hello, climate change)
- The "tenant-ready" property needed $15K in repairs
- Vacancy hit 3 months instead of the "expected" 1 month

The 1% rule was created in the 1970s when interest rates and insurance costs were completely different. Using it today is like navigating with a 50-year-old map.

What actually matters in 2025:
✓ Cash-on-cash return (after ALL expenses)
✓ Debt service coverage ratio (can you handle a bad month?)
✓ 5-year projection with realistic vacancy rates
✓ Scenario analysis (best case, realistic, worst case)

I built PropIQ because I was tired of seeing investors lose money on "good deals" that only looked good on paper.

Question for the real estate investors here: What outdated advice do you wish would die already?

## 📱 LINKEDIN POST #2 - "I Analyzed 1,000 Properties"

**When to post:** Post this 2-3 days after Post #1 (spacing out LinkedIn content)

**Copy this:**

```
I analyzed 1,000 rental properties last quarter. Here's what the data actually shows.

Everyone talks about real estate investing being "passive income." The data tells a different story.

Average Deal Score: 58/100 (that's a "Fair" rating - most deals are marginal at best)

The breakdown:
- Only 12% scored 80+ (Excellent) - truly great deals
- 23% scored 65-79 (Good) - solid, but not exceptional
- 41% scored 50-64 (Fair) - break-even or slight positive cash flow
- 24% scored below 50 (Poor/Avoid) - money losers

What separates the top 12% from the rest?

1. They bought right - Purchase price 15-20% below market
2. They knew the hidden costs - Budgeted 1.5% of property value for annual maintenance (not the BS 0.5% you see online)
3. They were conservative - Used 8-10% vacancy rates, not the optimistic 5%
4. They had backup plans - Scenario analysis showed they could weather 6 months vacancy

The bottom 24%?
- Fell for "great location!" (paid too much)
- Used seller's numbers (wildly optimistic)
- Ignored CapEx (roof, HVAC, etc.)
- Assumed perfect tenants (they don't exist)

Real estate can absolutely build wealth. But the math has to work BEFORE you sign the deal.

What's your #1 rule for evaluating rental properties?

## 🐦 TWITTER/X THREAD #1 - "Property Analysis Mistakes"

**When to post:** X performs best 6-9 AM or 8-10 PM ET

**Copy each tweet (keep numbering):**

**Tweet 1/7:**
```
I wasted $50K by NOT running this analysis before buying my rental property.

Here's the 30-second test that would have saved me:
```

**Tweet 2/7:**
```
Most investors focus on monthly cash flow.

"$400/month positive! This deal is great!"

Wrong. Monthly cash flow is a vanity metric without context.
```

**Tweet 3/7:**
```
The test that actually matters:

Can your property survive:
• 3 months vacancy
• $10K emergency repair
• 20% insurance increase
• Property tax reassessment

If any of these breaks your cash flow, you don't have a deal. You have a gamble.
```

**Tweet 4/7:**
```
Here's what I missed on my first property:

✅ Cash flow: +$420/month
❌ Vacancy reserve: $0
❌ CapEx budget: $0
❌ Insurance assumed: $1,200/year (actual: $3,400)
❌ Property tax increase: Didn't factor it in

Result: -$200/month actual cash flow
```

**Tweet 5/7:**
```
The properties that build wealth have:

1. DSCR > 1.25 (debt service coverage ratio)
2. 8-10% vacancy reserves
3. 1-2% of value for CapEx annually
4. Conservative rent assumptions
5. Best/realistic/worst case scenarios
```

**Tweet 6/7:**
```
Now I run every property through scenario analysis BEFORE I make an offer:

Best case: Everything goes right
Realistic case: Industry averages
Worst case: Murphy's Law

If worst case doesn't bankrupt me, I consider the deal.
```

**Tweet 7/7:**
```
Real estate builds wealth slowly and predictably.

If your deal requires perfect conditions to work, it's not an investment. It's a lottery ticket.

Do the math. Every time.

(I built @PropIQ because I was tired of 3-hour Excel sessions. 30-second AI analysis → never miss the red flags again)
```

## 💡 TIPS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT

### LinkedIn:
