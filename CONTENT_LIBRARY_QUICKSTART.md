## 📋 Day 1 Action Plan (Monday, Nov 4)

### Morning Routine (9:00 - 10:00 AM)

**Goal:** Comment on 10 posts BEFORE you post

**Where to find posts:**
- Leandrew Robinson's latest
- Sahil Bloom's morning thread
- Greg Isenberg's startup content
- Real estate investor posts
- Build-in-public founders

**What to comment:**
- Read their post fully
- Write 2-3 sentences (genuine, specific)
- Reference a specific point they made
- Add your own insight if relevant
- DO NOT pitch PropIQ (just be helpful)

**Example:**
"This point about [specific detail] resonates. We're facing the same challenge with PropIQ's user onboarding. Your approach of [their solution] is smart—we might try that."

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

**DON'T:**
❌ Post without engaging first (comment on 10 posts BEFORE posting)
❌ Ignore comments (reply within 1 hour or lose algorithm boost)
❌ Automate everything (keep responses personal)
❌ Pitch in every post (provide value first, sell second)
❌ Skip days (consistency beats perfection)
❌ Use generic comments ("Great post!" doesn't count)
❌ Post at random times (stick to calendar for data)

**DO:**
✅ Comment before posting (10 genuine comments)
✅ Respond fast (first hour = critical)
✅ Be vulnerable (founder journey resonates)
✅ Provide value (teach, don't sell)
✅ Post daily (even if imperfect)
✅ Write thoughtful comments (2-3 sentences)
✅ Test posting times (track what works)

---

- [ ] Repeat Week 1 process with next 7 posts (already written!)

## 💡 Pro Tips from Your Mentor

**Building in Public:**
- Share the messy middle, not just wins
- Numbers are interesting (67 likes, 12 comments, 5 signups)
- Day count creates accountability (Day 47, Day 48...)

**Storytelling (Leandrew Robinson Style):**
- Start with a hook ("I just lost $50K...")
- Use specific details (not "a property" but "$600K Miami condo")
- End with a lesson (what you learned, how PropIQ helps)

**Value Bombs (Sahil Bloom Style):**
- Teach one complete framework
- Use numbered lists (7 metrics, 5 steps, 3 principles)
- Make it scannable (emojis, bullet points, white space)

**Consistency:**
- Post at same time daily (builds habit for your audience)
- Don't wait for perfection (done > perfect)
- Batch content (write 7 posts on Sunday, schedule for week)
