Just spent 6 hours debugging our Chrome extension.

The issue? Content scripts weren't injecting on Zillow pages.

The fix? 3 lines of code in manifest.json.

Here's what I learned about building PropIQ:

1. Playwright tests ≠ real-world usage
   → Always test manually in the actual browser

2. Service workers need explicit events
   → Background scripts must register properly

3. MVP means "Minimum" not "Perfect"
   → Ship fast, iterate faster

We went from 11 failing tests to a working extension in one session.

Building @PropIQ in public. Day 47.

The Fed just cut interest rates.

Everyone's celebrating.

But here's what they're NOT telling you about homebuying in 2025:

🏠 Lower rates ≠ cheaper homes
   → Prices already adjusted upward

📈 Inventory is still historically tight
   → Supply hasn't magically increased

💰 Competition just got more intense
   → More buyers can now afford mortgages

⚠️ The 1% rule is harder than ever
   → Rent needs to be 1% of purchase price for cash flow

This is exactly why I built PropIQ.

Real estate decisions need REAL data, not just headlines.

Our AI analyzes:
→ Deal score (0-100)
→ Monthly cash flow (positive or negative)
→ Cap rate vs market average
→ Location-specific risks

In under 2 minutes.

**LinkedIn Post:**

3 months ago, I almost quit PropIQ.

Here's what changed:

I was stuck in perfectionism.

"The AI needs to be 100% accurate."
"The UI needs to be flawless."
"We need every feature before launch."

Classic founder trap.

Then my mentor asked me one question:

"What problem are you ACTUALLY solving?"

Not:
❌ Building the perfect AI
❌ Creating the prettiest UI
❌ Competing with Zillow

But:
✅ Helping investors make faster decisions
✅ Reducing analysis time from hours to minutes
✅ Giving access to AI-powered insights for $29/month (not $5,000 consultants)

That clarity changed everything.

I cut 60% of planned features.
Focused on ONE thing: property analysis.
Shipped an MVP in 3 weeks.

Now we're at:
→ Chrome extension live
→ Backend deployed on Railway
→ Real AI analysis working
→ 5 beta users testing

Building @PropIQ in public. Day 47.

What's the ONE question that changed your founder journey? 👇

### 📝 Day 4 Post: Lesson Learned (Deployment)
**Type:** Lesson Learned (Template 2)
**Platform:** LinkedIn + Twitter
**Scheduled Time:** 11:00 AM EST
**Post Length:** 1,100 characters

**LinkedIn Post:**

I just learned a $10,000 lesson about deployment.

And it only cost me 10 hours.

Here's what happened:

We deployed PropIQ's backend to Azure.
Deployment time: 10-15 minutes per push.
Total deploys during testing: 12.
Time wasted waiting: 2+ hours.

Then I switched to Railway.
Deployment time: 2-3 minutes.
Same 12 deploys: 24 minutes total.

Saved: 90+ minutes.

But here's the REAL lesson:

It's not about the tools.

It's about iteration speed.

When you can deploy in 2 minutes instead of 15:
→ You test more fearlessly
→ You fix bugs faster
→ You ship features quicker
→ You learn 5x faster

Fast feedback loops = faster product.

Building @PropIQ taught me:
Speed > Perfection in early stages.

What deployment setup do you use? Azure, Railway, Vercel, other? 👇

#DevOps #Startup #BuildInPublic #SaaS
```

**Twitter Post:**
```
Just learned a $10K lesson in 10 hours:

Azure: 15 min deploys
Railway: 2 min deploys

12 deploys = 2 hours vs 24 minutes

The real lesson?
Fast feedback loops = faster product.

Speed > Perfection

What's your deployment stack?

**Visual Asset:** Side-by-side comparison graphic (Azure vs Railway deployment times)

**Post-Posting Actions:**
- [ ] Engage with DevOps discussions
- [ ] Share Railway referral link if asked (affiliate opportunity)
- [ ] Collect deployment stack recommendations for future reference

I watched my friend lose $50,000 on a rental property.

Not because he's dumb.

But because he trusted the wrong data.

Here's what happened:

Month 1: He buys a "great deal" in Austin
→ Purchase price: $450K
→ Agent said: "Easy $2,500/month rent"
→ He believed it

Month 3: Property sits vacant
→ Market rent: Actually $1,800/month
→ Mortgage + expenses: $2,400/month
→ Losing $600/month

Month 12: He sells at a loss
→ Holding costs: $20K
→ Selling costs: $30K
→ Total loss: $50K

The problem?

He used:
❌ Zillow Zestimate (outdated)
❌ Agent's opinion (biased)
❌ "Gut feeling" (wishful thinking)

Not:
✅ Real market data
✅ Actual cash flow analysis
✅ Location-specific risks

This story haunts me.

Because it's preventable.

That's why I built PropIQ.

It gives you:
→ AI-powered analysis in 2 minutes
→ Realistic rent estimates (not guesses)
→ Monthly cash flow (positive or negative)
→ Deal score (0-100, color-coded)
→ Location-specific risks

For $29/month.

Less than one overpriced Zillow report.

We just hit a milestone with PropIQ.

And I'm honestly emotional about it.

5 beta users.
15 property analyses run.
0 crashes.

But here's what really matters:

One user messaged me yesterday:

"I almost bought a $600K property in Miami.

Your AI showed -$800/month cash flow.

I would've lost $9,600 in the first year alone.

PropIQ just saved me from a terrible decision.

Thank you."

That's why we build.

Not for:
❌ Vanity metrics
❌ Investor applause
❌ TechCrunch articles

But for:
✅ Real people
✅ Making better decisions
✅ Saving them from expensive mistakes

Building @PropIQ in public. Day 47.

To everyone who's tested, given feedback, or just cheered us on:

Thank you. 🙏

We're just getting started.

Next milestone: 50 users by end of month.

Who's joining us? Drop a 🏠 in the comments and I'll DM you early access.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Week 1

1. **Comment BEFORE you post** - This is non-negotiable. 10 comments first, then post.

2. **Vary your engagement** - Don't just like. Write thoughtful 2-3 sentence comments.

3. **Use your phone** - LinkedIn engagement is higher on mobile during commute hours (8-9 AM, 5-6 PM EST).

4. **Respond fast** - First hour of comments = algorithm boost. Be online when you post.

5. **Cross-pollinate** - Mention people you engaged with in your posts (tag them respectfully).

6. **Save high-performers** - If a post hits >150 likes, repurpose it for Twitter thread or newsletter.

7. **DM strategically** - Don't spam. DM only when there's genuine value to add.

8. **Document everything** - Take screenshots of metrics, save testimonials, log what works.
