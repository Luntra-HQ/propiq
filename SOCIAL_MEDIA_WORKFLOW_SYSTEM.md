# Social Media Workflow System

**How Top Marketers Document & Remember Everything**

## 🎯 The Problem You're Solving

**Challenge:** Too many platform-specific rules to remember (like "don't share IG Reel to Story immediately")

**Solution:** A 3-part documentation system that works

### 2. **Quick Checklist** (QUICK_POST_CHECKLIST.md)

**When to Use:** Before EVERY post (2-minute review)
**How Often:** Daily, before each post

### 3. **Learning Log** (SOCIAL_MEDIA_LEARNING_LOG.md)
**Purpose:** Capture what works/doesn't work for YOUR content
**When to Use:** After posting (2 minutes), review results after 24 hours
**How Often:** After every post, weekly pattern review

## 🧠 Memory Techniques (So You Don't Forget)

2. Review platform-specific rules
3. Create content with rules in mind
4. Re-check checklist before posting
5. Post
6. Engage for 30 minutes
7. Log results
```

After 2-3 weeks, this becomes automatic.

### 2. **Visual Reminders**
- Print Quick Checklist, tape to desk
- Set phone wallpaper with key rules
- Sticky note on monitor: "Don't share Reel to Story!"
- Calendar reminder before posting time

### 3. **Templated Captions**
Save caption templates in phone Notes:
```
Instagram Reel Template:
[Hook in first line]
[Value in middle]
[CTA at end]
3-5 hashtags only
DON'T share to Story immediately!
```

### 4. **Accountability Partner**
- DM a marketing friend after posting
- Share what you learned
- Ask them to remind you of rules
- Review each other's content

### 5. **Weekly Review Habit**
- Set calendar reminder: "Review Social Media Learnings"
- Sunday 6pm: Review week's posts
- What worked = add to Cardinal Rules
- What didn't work = add to "Don't Do" list
