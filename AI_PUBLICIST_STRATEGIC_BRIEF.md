**Stop if:**
1. Content takes more time than PropIQ development
2. Audience growth but zero PropIQ conversions
3. Chasing views/followers instead of qualified leads
4. Monetizing too early (before 1K subs)
5. Copying competitors instead of being unique
6. Building on platforms I don't own (Instagram, TikTok only)
7. Saying yes to everything (content FOMO)

**Ask "Is this PropIQ-first?" before every decision.**
