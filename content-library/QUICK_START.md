## 💡 Pro Tips

### Repurposing Content:

**One LinkedIn post can become:**
1. Instagram Reel (visual version)
2. Twitter thread (key points)
3. YouTube Short (same as Reel)
4. Blog post (expanded)
5. Email newsletter (summary)

**Result:** 1 hour → 6 pieces of content

### Time-Saving Hacks:

1. **Batch creation:** Write 4 posts in one sitting
2. **Template reuse:** Don't start from scratch
3. **Repurpose winners:** Create variations
4. **Schedule in advance:** Sunday for full week

### What to Track:

**Focus on:**
- Impressions (reach)
- Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares)
- Clicks (traffic)
- Sign-ups (conversions)

**Ignore:**
- Follower count (vanity metric)
- Likes only (without engagement)
