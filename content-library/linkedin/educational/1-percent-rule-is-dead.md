## Copy-Paste Ready:

```
The 1% rule fails investors more than any other "rule of thumb" in real estate.

Here's a common scenario:

$400K property. Rent is $3,200/month. "It passes the 1% rule!"

Six months later, the investor is bleeding cash.

What the 1% rule doesn't account for:
- Property tax reassessments (can increase 20-50% after purchase)
- Insurance rate increases (up 30-40% in many markets since 2020)
- Deferred maintenance that inspections miss
- Actual vacancy rates (often 8-10%, not the optimistic 5%)

The 1% rule was created in the 1970s when interest rates, insurance costs, and property taxes were completely different. Using it today is like navigating with a 50-year-old map.

What actually matters in 2025:
✓ Cash-on-cash return (after ALL expenses)
✓ Debt service coverage ratio (can you handle a bad month?)
✓ 5-year projection with realistic vacancy rates
✓ Scenario analysis (best case, realistic, worst case)

I built PropIQ by LUNTRA to help investors move beyond outdated rules and see the full picture before committing capital.

Question for the real estate investors here: What outdated advice do you wish would die already?
