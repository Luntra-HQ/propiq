## 🔄 Repurposing Strategy

**One Topic → Multiple Platforms:**

Example: "1% Rule is Dead"
1. **LinkedIn:** Long-form educational post (published Nov 12)
2. **Instagram Reel:** 45-second visual version (published Nov 12)
3. **YouTube Short:** Same video as Instagram (published Nov 12)
4. **Twitter Thread:** Key takeaways (published Nov 12)
5. **Blog Post:** Expanded 1,500-word guide (publish end of month)
6. **Email Newsletter:** Summary + link to blog (monthly)

**Result:** 1 hour of content creation = 6 distribution channels

## 📊 Performance Tracking

After each post goes live, update this:

### Top Performers (All Time)

| Post | Platform | Published | Impressions | Engagement | Clicks | Sign-ups |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|----------|
| [TBD] | LinkedIn | Nov 12 | - | - | - | - |
| [TBD] | Instagram | Nov 12 | - | - | - | - |
| [TBD] | Twitter | Nov 12 | - | - | - | - |

**Goal:** Double down on what works. If a post gets 2x average engagement, create variations.
