**Last Updated:** 2025-11-06
**Purpose:** Algorithm-specific rules and best practices to maximize reach and engagement

---

## 🚨 Universal Cardinal Rules (All Platforms)

### 1. **Post Natively**
- ❌ Don't use third-party schedulers for first post
- ✅ Post directly in the app for maximum reach
- 📱 Apps can detect non-native posts and suppress them

### 2. **Timing Matters**
- ⏰ Post when your audience is most active
- 📊 Check analytics for your best times
- 🔄 Don't post multiple times in quick succession (space out 4-6 hours)

### 3. **Engagement Window**
- ⚡ First 30-60 minutes are critical
- 👍 Respond to comments immediately
- 🔥 Algorithm boosts posts with early engagement

### 4. **Quality Over Quantity**
- 📉 One great post > Five mediocre posts
- 🎯 Better to post 3x/week with quality than daily with low effort

### 5. **Platform-Specific Content**
- ❌ Don't cross-post identical content everywhere
- ✅ Adapt format and style for each platform
- 🎨 Vertical video for TikTok/Reels, professional for LinkedIn
