# URL Verification Needed

## Multiple URLs Found:

1. **https://propiq.luntra.one** - Main custom domain (Cloudflare)
2. **https://luntra-propiq.netlify.app** - Netlify subdomain
3. **https://app.luntra.one** - Different project entirely

## What I Need From You:

Please copy/paste the EXACT URL you're looking at when you see the broken site.

Also, can you:
1. Open https://propiq.luntra.one in a NEW browser you've never used
2. Take a screenshot
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
4. Take a screenshot of any errors

This will help me see EXACTLY what you're seeing.

## Current Status:

My automated tests show https://propiq.luntra.one is working correctly with:
- ✅ Full CSS loaded
- ✅ React rendering
- ✅ No JavaScript errors
- ✅ Tailwind classes applied

But something is clearly wrong on your end. Let's figure out what's different.
