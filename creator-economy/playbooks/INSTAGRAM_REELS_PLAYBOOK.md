## 📅 Posting Strategy (Based on Social Media Examiner Intel)

### Optimal Times:
- **Best:** Tuesday-Thursday, 3:00-5:00 PM ET
- **Good:** Monday/Friday, 12:00-2:00 PM ET
- **Avoid:** Weekends (lower B2B engagement)

### Distribution Sequence (CRITICAL):
1. **Post Reel to feed** (3:00 PM)
2. **WAIT 2-3 hours** (let algorithm push to Explore)
3. **Share to Stories** (5:30-6:00 PM)
4. **Cross-post to YouTube Shorts** (same day or next)
5. **Optional:** Repurpose to TikTok (if audience fits)

**Why this works:**
- Instagram prioritizes one content type at a time
- Immediate Story share kills feed reach
- Waiting allows Explore/Recommendations momentum

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Posting Without Strategy
❌ "I'll just post and see what happens"
✅ Use content pillars, track what works, double down

### 2. Low-Quality Audio
❌ Phone microphone with echo
✅ Use trending audio OR invest in wireless mic ($30-50)

### 3. Too Much Text
❌ Paragraph of text on screen
✅ One sentence at a time, large font

### 4. No Hook
❌ Starting with "Hey guys, in this video..."
✅ Lead with the value: "The 1% rule will cost you money"

### 5. Ignoring Analytics
❌ Post and forget
✅ Check which Reels got saved/shared, make more like those

### 6. Sharing to Stories Immediately
❌ Post → instant Story share (kills reach)
✅ Post → wait 2-3 hours → Story share
