## 🎯 HIGH-IMPACT TACTICS (Implement Immediately)

### 1. Instagram Post Timing Fix - **CRITICAL**
**Problem:** Sharing to Stories immediately after posting kills feed reach
**Solution:** Post sequence strategy

**The Right Way:**
1. Publish post to feed FIRST
2. **WAIT 2-3 hours** (let algorithm push to Explore/Recommendations)
3. THEN share to Stories

**Why It Works:**
- Instagram algorithm prioritizes ONE content type at a time
- Immediate Story share signals "this is just a Story"
- Waiting allows post to gain momentum in feed/Explore
- Result: Extended post life + higher reach

**PropIQ Application:**
- Tuesday 7:00 AM: Post LinkedIn-style content to Instagram feed
- Tuesday 10:00 AM: Share to Stories with "New post up!" sticker
- Measure: Compare reach with old method (immediate share)

### 2. Facebook/Meta Platform Changes (2026 Planning)

#### Attribution Window Changes - **ACTION REQUIRED**
**Timeline:** January 2026

**What's Changing:**
- ❌ **Sunsetted:** 7-day view attribution window (completely gone)
- ⚠️ **Limited:** Can't compare attribution windows in Facebook UI
- ✅ **Keeping:** 1-day click, 7-day click, 28-day click, 1-day engaged view, 1-day view

**Action for PropIQ:**
- If running Facebook ads: Export current data BEFORE January 2026
- Switch reporting to 7-day click or 28-day click
- Consider third-party tools for attribution comparison (if needed)

#### Historical Data Limitations
**What's Limited:**
- Frequency metrics: 6 months max
- Unique actions: 13 months max
- Hourly stats: 13 months max

**Action:** If you track year-over-year comparisons, export data NOW

#### Automated Ads Phase-Out
**Status:** Already started (full discontinuation 2026)
- Can't create new automated ads
- Existing ones run until 2026
- **Shift to:** Advantage Plus campaigns (AI-optimized)

---

### 3. Instagram Competitive Insights Tool - **NEW FEATURE**

**What It Is:**
- Compare your profile vs. 10 similar accounts
- Available in Professional Dashboard (rolling out gradually)

**Metrics Provided:**

3. Benchmark: Post frequency, follower growth

### 4. Meta's AI Push - Advantage Plus Placements

**Recommendation from Meta:** Use Advantage Plus for most campaigns

**What It Does:**
- AI automatically optimizes ad placement
- Distributes across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Audience Network
- Learns what works, adjusts automatically

**New Feature (API users only):**
- **Placement Spend Flexibility:** Up to 5% budget on non-selected placements

- **Not default:** Must explicitly enable

**PropIQ Strategy:**

### 5. AI Agents for Marketing Automation

**Key Insight from Sara Davison:**

**Don't Rush to Full Autonomy:**
- Tools like AgentKit make AI agents accessible
- BUT: Accessibility ≠ Reliability
- Need systematic 4-step process (not just "set it and forget it")

**Step 2 - The Mock-up (Most Relevant for Us):**
1. Create mini MVP of AI agent
2. Test with real workflow
3. Gather feedback (what breaks, what's missing?)
4. Iterate until reliable

**Tools Mentioned:**
- **TypingMind:** Test multiple AI models in one interface
- **Cassidy AI:** No-code AI agent builder (beginner-friendly)

**Principle:** Stay LLM/tool/platform agnostic (landscape moving fast)

**PropIQ Application:**
- Our Slack automation is a "mini AI agent"
- Can expand to: content repurposing, performance tracking, engagement monitoring
- Follow mock-up → test → iterate approach

### 6. LinkedIn Performance Indicators

**Q1 FY26 Results:**
- Revenue: $18B (up 10% YoY)
- Membership: Approaching 1.3 billion
- **Engagement metrics:**
  - Comments: +24%
  - Video uploads: Double-digit growth (3 quarters straight)

**Takeaway:** LinkedIn engagement is RISING
- More comments = more algorithm favor
- Video is growing (consider LinkedIn video in future)
- PropIQ is posting at right time (LinkedIn is hot)

---

### 7. New Platform Features to Watch

#### Threads (Twitter/X alternative):
- **Reply Approval Tool:** Review replies before they appear
- Use case: Moderate spam, control narrative
- Available during post creation ("Reply options")

**PropIQ Consideration:** May not need immediately, but useful if PropIQ grows large following

#### Facebook Groups:
- **Private → Public Conversion:** Now possible
- Existing posts stay private (only new posts public)
- 3-day review period for admins

**PropIQ Consideration:** If we create Facebook community later
