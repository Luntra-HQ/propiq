## 🚀 Integration Guide

### Quick Integration (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Add Hero Section to App.tsx**

```tsx
// At the top of your App component
import { HeroSection } from './components/HeroSection';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-slate-900">
      {/* NEW: Hero Section */}
      <HeroSection
        onGetStarted={() => {
          document.getElementById('deal-calculator')?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
        }}
        onViewDemo={() => {
          // Show demo or leave blank for now
        }}
      />

      {/* Your existing dashboard code */}
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
        {/* ... */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Step 2: Add PDF Export After Analysis Results**

```tsx
import { PDFExportButton } from './components/PDFExportButton';
import { PropertyAnalysis } from './utils/pdfExport';

// Inside your component where you display PropIQ analysis
const [analysisResult, setAnalysisResult] = useState<PropertyAnalysis | null>(null);

// After analysis completes
useEffect(() => {
  if (dealIQResponse) {
    const analysis: PropertyAnalysis = {
      address: dealIQResponse.address,
      summary: dealIQResponse.summary,
      location: dealIQResponse.location,
      financials: dealIQResponse.financials,
      investment: dealIQResponse.investment,
      pros: dealIQResponse.pros,
      cons: dealIQResponse.cons,
      keyInsights: dealIQResponse.key_insights,
      nextSteps: dealIQResponse.next_steps,
      analyzedAt: new Date().toLocaleDateString(),
    };
    setAnalysisResult(analysis);
  }
}, [dealIQResponse]);

// In your JSX
return (
  <div>
    {/* Display analysis results */}
    {analysisResult && (
      <>
        {/* Your analysis display code */}

        {/* NEW: PDF Export Button */}
        <PDFExportButton
          analysis={analysisResult}
          variant="primary"
          size="lg"
          fullWidth
        />
      </>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

## 🎤 Demo Talking Points for Interview

### When Showing Hero Section

> "I designed this hero section with conversion optimization in mind. Notice the clear value prop above the fold, three concrete benefits instead of vague marketing speak, and social proof indicators. The gradient background and floating feature cards aren't just decorative — they're designed to communicate 'this is a modern, sophisticated tool' within 3 seconds of landing."

### When Showing PDF Export

> "One insight from user interviews: investors don't analyze properties alone. They need to share findings with partners, lenders, or contractors. That's why I built PDF export. It's not just a data dump — it's a branded, professional report with color-coded recommendations, pros/cons analysis, and actionable next steps. The generation happens client-side using jsPDF, so there's no server overhead, and PDFs download in under 2 seconds."

### If Asked About Implementation

> "The PDF generator uses jsPDF with a custom layout engine. I built a helper function that handles automatic page breaks, color-codes metrics based on thresholds (green for cap rate >8%, yellow for 5-8%, red for <5%), and gracefully handles missing data. For example, if a user hasn't run the deal calculator, the PDF just omits that section instead of breaking."

### If Asked About Roadmap Integration

> "PDF export was actually on my 12-month roadmap as a Q1 2026 feature. But during interview prep, I realized it would be a perfect demo piece, so I built it in a day. That's the benefit of being a solo founder — I can ship fast when needed. Next iteration will add email delivery ('send PDF to my inbox') and custom branding for Pro tier users."

## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Change Hero CTA Text

```

### Change PDF Header Color

```tsx
// In pdfExport.ts, line 73

// Change to:
pdf.setFillColor(16, 185, 129); // emerald
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Hero section overlaps existing content

**Fix:** Add `position: relative; z-index: 10` to hero section

```tsx
<section className="relative z-10 bg-gradient-to-br...">
```

### Issue: PDF button doesn't download

**Fix:** Check browser console for errors. Likely causes:
1. `jspdf` not installed: Run `npm install jspdf html2canvas`
2. Analysis data is null: Verify `analysis` prop is passed
3. Browser blocks download: Check browser settings

### Issue: PDF layout is broken

**Fix:** Check analysis data structure. Run:

```tsx
console.log('Analysis data:', analysisData);
```

Ensure it matches the `PropertyAnalysis` interface.

✅ "PDF export is a nice touch"
✅ "This feels like a real product, not just a demo"
✅ "Walk me through how you built the PDF generator"
✅ "What other features are on your roadmap?"

**Red flags to avoid:**

## 🚦 Pre-Interview Checklist

**24 Hours Before:**
- [ ] Test full demo flow (hero → calculator → analysis → PDF)

- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Test screen share (Zoom/Google Meet)

**During Interview:**
- [ ] Speak slowly (nerves make you rush)
- [ ] Pause after each section (let them absorb)
- [ ] Ask "Would you like me to explain how this works?" (shows depth)

## 🎓 Advanced Features (If You Have Time)

If you want to go above and beyond before the interview:

### 1. Add Hero Section A/B Testing

Track which CTA gets more clicks:

```tsx
const [ctaClicked, setCtaClicked] = useState<'get_started' | 'view_demo' | null>(null);

<HeroSection
  onGetStarted={() => {
    analytics.track('Hero_CTA_Clicked', { button: 'get_started' });
    setCtaClicked('get_started');
  }}
  onViewDemo={() => {
    analytics.track('Hero_CTA_Clicked', { button: 'view_demo' });
    setCtaClicked('view_demo');
  }}
/>
```

### 2. Add Email Delivery to PDF

Instead of just downloading, offer "Email PDF" button:

```tsx
const emailPDF = async (analysis: PropertyAnalysis, email: string) => {
  const pdfBlob = await generatePDFBlob(analysis); // Modify generatePDF to return blob

  // Send to backend
  await fetch('/api/email-pdf', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, pdfBlob }),
  });
};
```

### 3. Add PDF Preview Before Download

Show a thumbnail preview:

```tsx
const [pdfPreview, setPdfPreview] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Generate PDF as data URL
const previewPDF = async () => {
  const pdf = await generatePDFObject(analysis);
  const dataUrl = pdf.output('dataurlstring');
  setPdfPreview(dataUrl);
};
```
