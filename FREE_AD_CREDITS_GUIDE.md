## 💡 Pro Tips: Maximizing Free Credits

### 1. Stack Credits Across Platforms
- Use Google Ads for high-intent keywords
- Use Bing Ads for cheaper CPC (same keywords)
- Use Meta for retargeting
- Use LinkedIn for B2B leads (if targeting agents/brokers)

### 2. Set Daily Budget Limits
Don't burn through credits in 1 week:
- Google: $15/day = 33 days of ads
- Bing: $10/day = 10 days ($100 credit)
- Meta: $10/day = 20 days ($200 credit)
- **Total: 60+ days of free advertising**

### 3. Test Before You Spend
Use free credits to:
- Test which keywords convert best
- Test ad copy variations
- Find your cost per acquisition (CPA)
- Optimize landing pages

**Once you find what works**, THEN spend your own money to scale.

### 4. Use Credits Before They Expire
Most credits expire in 60-90 days. Set reminders:
- Week 1: Set up campaigns
- Week 2-8: Run campaigns, collect data
- Week 9: Analyze results, optimize
- Week 10-12: Scale what works (before credits expire)

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Burning credits too fast** - $500 in 1 week = no time to optimize
2. **Broad targeting** - "Real estate" is too vague (expensive clicks)
3. **No conversion tracking** - Can't tell which ads work
4. **Ignoring Bing** - 50% cheaper CPC, same audience

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Spread credits over 30-60 days** - Test, learn, optimize
2. **Narrow targeting** - "Cap rate calculator" (specific intent)
3. **Install conversion tracking** - Track free trials and paid signups
4. **Run Google + Bing simultaneously** - Same ads, cheaper on Bing
