### 2. First User Welcome Email

**Subject:** Welcome to PropIQ! Let's analyze your first property

Hi [Name],

Welcome to PropIQ! 🎉

I'm Brian, the founder. I built PropIQ because I was tired of watching investors spend hours in Excel analyzing properties (or worse, skipping analysis entirely and making gut decisions).

**Here's how to get started:**
1. Click the calculator on the homepage
2. Enter property details (purchase price, rent, expenses)
3. Get instant results: cash flow, cap rate, ROI, and a 0-100 deal score

You have **3 free analyses** to test it out. No credit card required.

**Need help?** Just reply to this email - I read every message.

Looking forward to helping you find your next great deal!

### LinkedIn Launch Announcement (Personal Story)

**Title:** I'm excited to announce PropIQ is officially live! 🎉

After months of building and testing with 50+ beta users, we've created an AI-powered property analysis tool that changes how investors evaluate deals.

**The Problem:**
Most investors spend 2-3 hours in Excel analyzing each property. Many skip analysis entirely and rely on gut feel. Some buy bad deals because the math looked okay on the surface.

**The Solution:**
PropIQ analyzes any rental property in 30 seconds:
• Calculates cash flow, cap rate, ROI, and 10+ metrics
• Generates a 0-100 deal score (instant go/no-go decision)
• Models 5-year scenarios (best case, worst case)
• Flags potential red flags (1% rule violations, negative cash flow)

**Why I Built This:**
I watched too many friends buy properties that "seemed good" only to lose money month after month. Real estate investing shouldn't require a finance degree or hours of spreadsheet work.

**Try it free:** https://propiq.luntra.one (3 analyses, no credit card)

### Reddit Posts

#### r/SaaS

**Title:** Launched PropIQ - AI-powered real estate analysis SaaS ($49-$199 MRR)

Hey r/SaaS!

I just launched PropIQ after 6 months of building: https://propiq.luntra.one

**What it does:**
Analyzes rental properties in 30 seconds (vs. hours in Excel). Calculates cash flow, cap rate, ROI, deal scores, and 5-year projections.

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB + Azure OpenAI
- Payments: Stripe
- Hosting: Azure Web Apps

**Pricing:**
- Free: 3 trial analyses
- Starter ($49/mo): 20 analyses/month
- Pro ($99/mo): 100 analyses/month
- Elite ($199/mo): Unlimited

**Launch strategy:**
Following MicroConf's launch week checklist. Manual onboarding for first users, collecting feedback, iterating daily.

**Challenges so far:**
- Finding real estate investor communities (harder than SaaS communities!)
- Explaining value prop in <10 seconds
- Balancing feature requests vs. core product

**What's working:**
- Interactive demo on homepage (3 free analyses)
- Deal scoring (0-100) - people love instant go/no-go
- Low-touch funnel (no sales calls needed)

Happy to answer questions about the build, tech stack, or launch strategy!

#### r/realestateinvesting

**Title:** Built a tool that analyzes rental properties in 30 seconds (free to try)

Hey everyone,

I'm a real estate investor and software developer. I got tired of spending hours in Excel analyzing properties, so I built PropIQ: https://propiq.luntra.one

**What it does:**
- Enter property details (price, rent, expenses)
- Get instant cash flow, cap rate, ROI calculations
- See a 0-100 "deal score" (instant go/no-go decision)
- Model 5-year scenarios

**It's free to try** (3 analyses, no credit card).

I'd love feedback from real investors:
- Is the calculator missing any key metrics?
- Would you pay $49/month for unlimited analyses?
- What would make this more useful?

Not trying to spam - genuinely want to build something investors actually use. Let me know what you think!

5. Reach out to real estate podcasters for guest spots

### Growth Channels to Double Down On
- **Twitter:** Daily tips on real estate investing + PropIQ features

- **Content:** 1-2 blog posts/week on real estate analysis

---

## Important Notes

- **Stay responsive:** Reply to all feedback within 24 hours
- **Be personal:** Sign emails with your name, not "The PropIQ Team"
- **Track everything:** Use spreadsheet to monitor daily metrics
- **Ship fixes fast:** If users report bugs, fix same day
- **Celebrate wins:** Share testimonials, user wins, milestones

**Remember:** Launch week is about learning, not revenue. Focus on getting feedback and building relationships with early users.
