## 🚫 NEVER DO THIS

```

❌ Post with watermarks from other platforms
❌ Post and ghost (must engage 30-60 min after)
❌ Use more than 5 hashtags on Instagram/TikTok
❌ Add links to LinkedIn post body (kills reach)
❌ Cross-post identical content everywhere
```

---

## ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS

```
✅ Post natively in the app (not scheduler for first post)
✅ Engage for 30-60 minutes after posting
✅ Reply to every comment immediately
✅ Hook in first 1-3 seconds
✅ Add captions/text (80% watch without sound)
✅ Log results after 24 hours
```

## 🎯 YOUR MARKETING FUNNEL (Simple)

## 💰 MATH: WHAT IT TAKES

### To Get 10 Paying Customers/Month:
- Need: 10,000 impressions
- = 500 engaged users (5%)
- = 150 trial users (30%)

- = 10 customers (70%)

**How to get 10K impressions:**
