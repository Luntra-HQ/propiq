## 🚨 Red Flags (Stop & Pivot)

### 🚩 Red Flag 1: AI Output Sounds Robotic
**Problem:** Content lacks personality
**Fix:** Add this to prompt: "Use conversational tone, short sentences, active voice. Write like founder talking to friend."

### 🚩 Red Flag 2: Factual Errors in Content
**Problem:** Gemini hallucinated statistics
**Fix:** ALWAYS verify with Perplexity before publishing

### 🚩 Red Flag 3: Spending >1hr on Single Task
**Problem:** Over-complicating simple tasks
**Fix:** Time-box each tool session (set timer)

### 🚩 Red Flag 4: Zero Engagement Despite AI Content
**Problem:** Content is technically good but not resonating
**Fix:** Switch from AI-heavy to human-heavy (share personal stories, authentic struggles)

### 🚩 Red Flag 5: Tool Paralysis (Which to Use?)
**Problem:** Spending 10min deciding which tool
**Fix:** Use this quick reference guide (30-second decision)
