## Week 1 Posts

### Day 1: Build Update (Monday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn + Twitter
**Best Time:** 12:00 PM EST
**Type:** Build Update (40%)

```
Just spent 6 hours debugging our Chrome extension.

The issue? Content scripts weren't injecting on Zillow pages.

The fix? 3 lines of code in manifest.json.

Here's what I learned about building PropIQ:

1. Playwright tests ≠ real-world usage
   → Always test manually in the actual browser

2. Service workers need explicit events
   → Background scripts must register properly

3. MVP means "Minimum" not "Perfect"
   → Ship fast, iterate faster

We went from 11 failing tests to a working extension in one session.

### Day 2: Hot Take + Market Commentary (Tuesday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 9:00 AM EST
**Type:** Hot Take + Product Insert

```
The Fed just cut interest rates.

Everyone's celebrating.

But here's what they're NOT telling you about homebuying in 2025:

🏠 Lower rates ≠ cheaper homes
   → Prices already adjusted upward

📈 Inventory is still historically tight
   → Supply hasn't magically increased

💰 Competition just got more intense
   → More buyers can now afford mortgages

⚠️ The 1% rule is harder than ever
   → Rent needs to be 1% of purchase price for cash flow

This is exactly why I built PropIQ.

Real estate decisions need REAL data, not just headlines.

Our AI analyzes:
→ Deal score (0-100)
→ Monthly cash flow (positive or negative)
→ Cap rate vs market average
→ Location-specific risks

In under 2 minutes.

### Day 3: Founder Journey Story (Wednesday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 1:00 PM EST
**Type:** Founder Journey (20%)

```
3 months ago, I almost quit PropIQ.

Here's what changed:

I was stuck in perfectionism.

"The AI needs to be 100% accurate."
"The UI needs to be flawless."
"We need every feature before launch."

Classic founder trap.

Then my mentor asked me one question:

"What problem are you ACTUALLY solving?"

Not:
❌ Building the perfect AI
❌ Creating the prettiest UI
❌ Competing with Zillow

But:
✅ Helping investors make faster decisions
✅ Reducing analysis time from hours to minutes
✅ Giving access to AI-powered insights for $29/month (not $5,000 consultants)

That clarity changed everything.

I cut 60% of planned features.
Focused on ONE thing: property analysis.
Shipped an MVP in 3 weeks.

Now we're at:
→ Chrome extension live
→ Backend deployed on Railway
→ Real AI analysis working
→ 5 beta users testing

### Day 4: Lesson Learned (Thursday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn + Twitter
**Best Time:** 11:00 AM EST
**Type:** Lesson Learned (30%)

```
I just learned a $10,000 lesson about deployment.

And it only cost me 10 hours.

Here's what happened:

We deployed PropIQ's backend to Azure.
Deployment time: 10-15 minutes per push.
Total deploys during testing: 12.
Time wasted waiting: 2+ hours.

Then I switched to Railway.
Deployment time: 2-3 minutes.
Same 12 deploys: 24 minutes total.

Saved: 90+ minutes.

But here's the REAL lesson:

It's not about the tools.

It's about iteration speed.

When you can deploy in 2 minutes instead of 15:
→ You test more fearlessly
→ You fix bugs faster
→ You ship features quicker
→ You learn 5x faster

Fast feedback loops = faster product.

Building @PropIQ taught me:
Speed > Perfection in early stages.

What deployment setup do you use? Azure, Railway, Vercel, other? 👇

#DevOps #Startup #BuildInPublic #SaaS
```

**Twitter Version:**
```
Just learned a $10K lesson in 10 hours:

Azure: 15 min deploys
Railway: 2 min deploys

12 deploys = 2 hours vs 24 minutes

The real lesson?
Fast feedback loops = faster product.

Speed > Perfection

### Day 5: Value Bomb (Sahil Bloom Style) (Friday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn Thread
**Best Time:** 8:00 AM EST
**Type:** Value Bomb (Educational)

```
The 7 Financial Metrics Every Real Estate Investor MUST Know

(But most beginners ignore #4)

A thread 🧵

1/ Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)

Formula: Net Operating Income / Purchase Price

Example:
→ Purchase: $500K
→ Annual NOI: $30K
→ Cap Rate: 6%

What it means: Your annual return if you paid cash.

Good cap rate: 5-8% (depends on market).

---

2/ Cash-on-Cash Return

Formula: Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested

Example:
→ Down payment: $100K
→ Annual cash flow: $6K
→ CoC Return: 6%

What it means: Return on YOUR money (not the bank's).

Target: 8%+ is solid.

---

3/ The 1% Rule

Formula: Monthly Rent / Purchase Price ≥ 1%

Example:
→ Purchase: $300K
→ Rent needed: $3,000/month

What it means: Quick filter for cash-flowing properties.

Reality in 2025: Hard to find in hot markets.

---

4/ Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

Formula: Net Operating Income / Annual Debt Service

Example:
→ NOI: $40K
→ Mortgage payments: $32K
→ DSCR: 1.25

What it means: Can the property cover its debt?

Banks want: 1.2-1.25 minimum.

Below 1.0 = negative cash flow.

---

5/ Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)

Formula: Purchase Price / Gross Annual Rent

Example:
→ Purchase: $400K
→ Annual rent: $48K
→ GRM: 8.3

What it means: How many years to pay off property with rent.

Lower is better. Under 10 is ideal.

---

6/ Operating Expense Ratio

Formula: Operating Expenses / Gross Income

Example:
→ Gross income: $50K
→ Operating expenses: $20K
→ OER: 40%

What it means: What % of income goes to expenses.

Target: 35-45% for residential.

---

7/ Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

Formula: Complex (accounts for time value of money)

What it means: Your annualized return over the investment period.

Includes:
→ Cash flow
→ Appreciation
→ Tax benefits
→ Exit value

Target: 12%+ for good deals.

---

Why this matters:

Most people buy real estate based on:
→ "Good feeling"
→ "Great location"
→ "My agent said it's a deal"

That's not investing. That's gambling.

PropIQ calculates all 7 metrics automatically.

In under 2 minutes.

Using AI that analyzes:
→ Location-specific market data
→ Realistic rent estimates
→ Cash flow projections
→ Risk factors

### Day 6: Problem Story (Saturday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 10:00 AM EST
**Type:** Problem-Obsessed (Leandrew Robinson Style)

```
I watched my friend lose $50,000 on a rental property.

Not because he's dumb.

But because he trusted the wrong data.

Here's what happened:

Month 1: He buys a "great deal" in Austin
→ Purchase price: $450K
→ Agent said: "Easy $2,500/month rent"
→ He believed it

Month 3: Property sits vacant
→ Market rent: Actually $1,800/month
→ Mortgage + expenses: $2,400/month
→ Losing $600/month

Month 12: He sells at a loss
→ Holding costs: $20K
→ Selling costs: $30K
→ Total loss: $50K

The problem?

He used:
❌ Zillow Zestimate (outdated)
❌ Agent's opinion (biased)
❌ "Gut feeling" (wishful thinking)

Not:
✅ Real market data
✅ Actual cash flow analysis
✅ Location-specific risks

This story haunts me.

Because it's preventable.

That's why I built PropIQ.

It gives you:
→ AI-powered analysis in 2 minutes
→ Realistic rent estimates (not guesses)
→ Monthly cash flow (positive or negative)
→ Deal score (0-100, color-coded)
→ Location-specific risks

For $29/month.

Less than one overpriced Zillow report.

### Day 7: Milestone Celebration (Sunday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn + Twitter
**Best Time:** 7:00 PM EST
**Type:** Milestone + Gratitude

```
We just hit a milestone with PropIQ.

And I'm honestly emotional about it.

5 beta users.
15 property analyses run.
0 crashes.

But here's what really matters:

One user messaged me yesterday:

"I almost bought a $600K property in Miami.

Your AI showed -$800/month cash flow.

I would've lost $9,600 in the first year alone.

PropIQ just saved me from a terrible decision.

Thank you."

That's why we build.

Not for:
❌ Vanity metrics
❌ Investor applause
❌ TechCrunch articles

But for:
✅ Real people
✅ Making better decisions
✅ Saving them from expensive mistakes

Building @PropIQ in public. Day 47.

To everyone who's tested, given feedback, or just cheered us on:

Thank you. 🙏

We're just getting started.

Next milestone: 50 users by end of month.

### Day 8: Build Update - AI Prompt Engineering (Monday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 12:00 PM EST
**Type:** Build Update (40%)

```
I just rewrote PropIQ's AI prompt.

It took 3 hours.

The results? 10x better.

Here's what I changed:

BEFORE (Generic):
"Analyze this property and provide investment insights."

AFTER (Specific):
"You are a real estate analyst with 15+ years experience.
Use realistic market data for [neighborhood].
Calculate cash flow: Rent - (Mortgage + Tax + Insurance + Maintenance).
Cap rate must be realistic (3-8% typical).
If cash flow is negative, recommend 'Hold' or 'Avoid'.
Provide location-specific risks."

The difference?

Before:
→ Deal score: Always 70-80 (useless)
→ Cash flow: Often $0 (AI didn't calculate)
→ Risks: Generic ("market volatility")

After:
→ Deal score: Realistic range (35-85)
→ Cash flow: Accurate (+$450 or -$200)
→ Risks: Specific ("Austin rent growth slowing, new supply coming online")

Key lessons in prompt engineering:

1. Be SPECIFIC about calculations
   → Don't assume AI knows formulas

2. Give EXAMPLES of good output
   → "Strong Buy = positive cash flow, cap rate >6%"

3. Add VALIDATION rules
   → "All values must be non-zero and realistic"

4. Include CONTEXT
   → "Use Zillow rent methodology"

Building @PropIQ taught me:

The quality of your AI output = The quality of your prompt.

Garbage in, garbage out.

### Day 9: Hot Take - Real Estate vs Stocks (Tuesday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 9:00 AM EST
**Type:** Hot Take

```
Unpopular opinion:

Most people should NOT invest in real estate.

Here's why:

Real estate investing is HARD:

→ Requires 20-25% down payment ($50K-$100K+)
→ Illiquid (can't sell in 24 hours like stocks)
→ Maintenance costs (1-2% of property value annually)
→ Tenant headaches (late payments, damages, evictions)
→ Time intensive (not passive, despite what gurus say)
→ Location risk (market can crash locally)

Meanwhile, S&P 500 index funds:

→ Minimum investment: $1
→ Liquid (sell anytime)
→ No maintenance
→ No tenants
→ Truly passive
→ Diversified (500 companies)
→ Historical return: 10% annually

So why do I still invest in real estate?

Because when done RIGHT, it offers:

✅ Leverage (use bank's money)
✅ Tax benefits (depreciation, 1031 exchange)
✅ Cash flow (monthly income, not just appreciation)
✅ Inflation hedge (rents rise with inflation)
✅ Forced appreciation (renovations increase value)

But "done right" requires:

1. Knowing the numbers (not guessing)
2. Analyzing deals quickly (see 100, buy 1)
3. Understanding local markets (not just national trends)

That's why I built PropIQ.

To help investors:
→ Analyze deals in 2 minutes (not 2 hours)
→ Get realistic cash flow projections
→ Understand location-specific risks
→ Make data-driven decisions

Real estate CAN be great.

But only if you do your homework.

### Day 10: Lesson Learned - Pricing Strategy (Wednesday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 11:00 AM EST
**Type:** Lesson Learned (30%)

```
I just changed PropIQ's pricing.

From $79/month to $29/month.

Here's why:

I made the classic founder mistake:

"Our AI is sophisticated, so we should charge premium prices."

Wrong.

Here's what I learned talking to 20 potential users:

User 1: "I'd pay $300 for a single comprehensive report."
User 2: "I analyze 10-20 properties per month, $79/mo is too much."
User 3: "For $79, I expect a full market analysis, not just AI insights."

The pattern?

People valued:
→ Speed > Depth (2 min analysis beats 2-hour reports)
→ Volume > Quality (analyze 20 deals to find 1 good one)
→ Accessibility > Sophistication (just tell me if it's a good deal)

So I repositioned:

OLD: "AI-powered comprehensive real estate analysis"
Price: $79/month (20 analyses)

NEW: "Analyze any property in 2 minutes with AI"
Price: $29/month (20 analyses)

Same product. Different framing.

The result?

→ 3x more demo requests
→ Lower barrier to entry
→ Competing with Zillow reports ($300 each), not CoStar ($5K/year)

Key lesson:

Your product's value ≠ Your technology's sophistication

Value = What problem you solve × How fast you solve it

Building @PropIQ taught me:

Price for your customer's reality, not your product's complexity.

### Day 11: Founder Journey - Impostor Syndrome (Thursday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 1:00 PM EST
**Type:** Founder Journey (20%)

```
"You're not a real estate expert. Why would anyone use PropIQ?"

I asked myself this 100 times.

Here's the truth:

I'm NOT a real estate expert.

I've never:
→ Flipped a house
→ Managed a rental portfolio
→ Worked as a real estate agent
→ Closed 50+ deals

But I AM an expert in:

→ Building software
→ Analyzing data
→ Solving problems
→ Talking to users

And here's what I learned:

The best founders don't solve problems they're experts in.

They solve problems they're OBSESSED with.

Examples:

Brian Chesky (Airbnb):
→ Not a hotel expert
→ Just needed a place to stay

Travis Kalanick (Uber):
→ Not a taxi expert
→ Just couldn't get a ride

Drew Houston (Dropbox):
→ Not a storage expert
→ Just kept forgetting his USB drive

Me (PropIQ):
→ Not a real estate expert
→ Just tired of spending 2 hours analyzing each property

The difference?

Experts optimize existing solutions.
Outsiders reimagine the entire problem.

I don't need to be a real estate guru.

I need to:
✅ Understand investors' pain points
✅ Build software that solves them
✅ Ship fast and iterate

That's it.

Building @PropIQ in public. Day 47.

Impostor syndrome doesn't go away.

You just learn to build anyway.

### Day 12: Value Bomb - How to Analyze a Property (Friday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn Thread
**Best Time:** 8:00 AM EST
**Type:** Value Bomb (Educational)

```
How to Analyze a Rental Property in 10 Minutes

(The exact framework I use for PropIQ)

A step-by-step guide 🧵

---

Step 1: Gather Basic Info (2 minutes)

You need:
→ Address
→ Purchase price
→ Property type (single-family, condo, multi-family)
→ Bedrooms/bathrooms

Where to find it:
→ Zillow
→ Realtor.com
→ MLS listing

---

Step 2: Estimate Monthly Rent (2 minutes)

Method 1: Zillow Rent Zestimate
→ Go to Zillow
→ Search address
→ Click "Rent Zestimate"

Method 2: Rentometer
→ Enter address
→ See comparable rents

Method 3: Call 3 property managers
→ Ask: "What would this rent for?"

Use the LOWEST estimate (be conservative).

---

Step 3: Calculate Monthly Expenses (3 minutes)

Fixed costs:
→ Mortgage (use mortgage calculator)
→ Property tax (1-2% of purchase price annually)
→ Insurance (0.5-1% annually)
→ HOA fees (if applicable)

Variable costs:
→ Maintenance (1% annually)
→ Vacancy (8-10% of rent)
→ Property management (8-10% of rent)

Example:
$400K purchase, 20% down, 7.5% interest, $320K loan

Mortgage: $2,237/month
Tax: $400/month (1.2% annually)
Insurance: $167/month (0.5% annually)
Maintenance: $333/month (1%)
Vacancy: $200/month (assume $2,000 rent)
Management: $200/month (10%)

Total: $3,537/month

---

Step 4: Calculate Monthly Cash Flow (1 minute)

Formula: Monthly Rent - Monthly Expenses

Example:
Rent: $2,000
Expenses: $3,537
Cash Flow: -$1,537/month ❌

This is a BAD deal.

You'd lose $18,444 per year.

---

Step 5: Calculate Key Metrics (2 minutes)

Cap Rate:
→ (Annual Rent - Annual Operating Expenses) / Purchase Price
→ ($24,000 - $13,200) / $400,000 = 2.7% ❌
→ Target: 5-8%

Cash-on-Cash Return:
→ Annual Cash Flow / Cash Invested
→ (-$18,444) / $80,000 = -23% ❌
→ Target: 8%+

1% Rule:
→ Monthly Rent / Purchase Price
→ $2,000 / $400,000 = 0.5% ❌
→ Target: 1%+

---

Step 6: Decision (1 minute)

If all 3 metrics fail → AVOID

If 2/3 metrics pass → INVESTIGATE (maybe appreciation play)

If 3/3 metrics pass → ANALYZE FURTHER (great deal)

---

Why this matters:

Most investors:
→ Fall in love with the property
→ Ignore the numbers
→ Lose money for years

Smart investors:
→ Analyze 100 properties
→ Make offers on 10
→ Buy 1

PropIQ automates this ENTIRE process.

### Day 13: Build Update - Testing with Real Users (Saturday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 10:00 AM EST
**Type:** Build Update (40%)

```
Just ran PropIQ's first live user testing session.

It was humbling.

Here's what I learned:

I thought our UI was intuitive.

User 1: "Where do I click to analyze a property?"
→ (The button was literally labeled "Analyze")

I thought the results were clear.

User 2: "What does 'Cap Rate' mean?"
→ (I forgot not everyone speaks real estate)

I thought 2 minutes was fast.

User 3: "Can't I just get the answer faster?"
→ (They wanted 30 seconds, not 2 minutes)

Watching users struggle with what I thought was "obvious" was painful.

But incredibly valuable.

Changes we're making to PropIQ:

1. Bigger, clearer CTAs
   → "Analyze This Property" button is now 2x larger

2. Tooltips for jargon
   → Hover over "Cap Rate" to see definition

3. Instant results
   → Show "Analyzing..." with progress bar
   → Display results as they stream in

4. Visual indicators
   → Color-coded deal scores (green = good, red = bad)
   → Icons for positive/negative cash flow

Key lesson:

Your users don't think like you.

And that's a GOOD thing.

They show you what you're blind to.

### Day 14: Problem Story - The Hidden Costs (Sunday)
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Best Time:** 7:00 PM EST
**Type:** Problem-Obsessed

```
Nobody talks about the REAL costs of real estate investing.

Let me show you what I mean.

Most people see this:

Purchase price: $300,000
Down payment: $60,000 (20%)
Monthly rent: $2,400
Monthly mortgage: $1,800
"Cash flow": $600/month ✅

Looks great, right?

Wrong.

Here are the costs they FORGOT:

1. Property Tax: $300/month
   → (1.2% annually is typical)

2. Insurance: $125/month
   → (More in FL, TX, CA)

3. HOA Fees: $150/month
   → (Condos and some SFH)

4. Maintenance: $250/month
   → (1% of property value annually)

5. Vacancy: $200/month
   → (Property sits empty 8% of year)

6. Property Management: $240/month
   → (10% of rent, unless you self-manage)

7. CapEx Reserve: $150/month
   → (Roof, HVAC, appliances eventually fail)

ACTUAL monthly expenses: $3,215

ACTUAL cash flow: -$815/month ❌

You'd LOSE $9,780 per year.

This is why 90% of "house hackers" fail.

They forget the hidden costs.

PropIQ calculates ALL of these automatically.

And shows you:
→ Real monthly cash flow (positive or negative)
→ Cap rate (realistic, not fantasy)
→ Deal score (0-100, accounts for all costs)

In under 2 minutes.
